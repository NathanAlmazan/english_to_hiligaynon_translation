many people believe that some unseen force controls their future .  based on this belief , they follow practices that they feel will improve their personal prospects .  astrology  some people believe that their future is fixed based on the way the stars were lined up at the moment of their birth .  they consult astrological forecasts , or horoscopes , to find out what will befall them and then act to avoid harm or find success .  feng shui  others believe that the key to success is to bring their surroundings into harmony with unseen forces in nature .  lo wing ,  who lives in hong kong , says ,  a feng shui master told me that putting a special crystal in a designated place in my store would help me earn more money .  ancestor worship  still others believe that they must appease dead ancestors or various deities to gain their protection and blessing .  van , who lives in vietnam , says ,  i believed that by paying homage to my ancestors , i would enjoy a better life now and a secure future for me and my children .  reincarnation  many view existence as an endless cycle of life , death , and rebirth .  they believe that the good or bad they experience now is the result of events in a previous life .  many , though , consider such beliefs as superstition .  yet , they still dabble in palmistry , horoscopes , ouija  boards , tarot cards , and the like .  they feel that perhaps there is a chance that such practices can help them know their future .  have those who trust in such beliefs and practices found a good life and a secure future .  consider the experience of h�o , who lives in vietnam .  he turned to astrology , feng shui , and ancestor worship to guide him .  did he find success .  h�o says ,  i failed in my business , fell into debt , faced family conflicts , and was emotionally wrecked .  qiuming , from taiwan , likewise believed in astrology , reincarnation , fate , feng shui , and ancestor worship .  after examining these subjects carefully , he said   i realized that such teachings and customs are in conflict with each other and are confusing .  i found that the astrological predictions were often incorrect .  as for reincarnation , if you have no memory of your previous life , how can you change and do better in the next life .  i realized that such teachings and customs are in conflict with each other and are confusing .  qiuming , taiwan as h�o , qiuming , and many others have come to realize , our future is not determined by fate , the stars , deceased ancestors , or rebirth .  does this mean that we have no control over our future .  although many things that happen to us are beyond our control , experience tells us that our choices do affect our future .  because choosing to do so can protect our life .  clearly , your choices matter .  of course , we need to make wise choices if we want to get good results .  many feel that the way to guarantee a better future is for them to pursue higher education and wealth .  what have been the results for some who have made that choice .  the thought is expressed in such popular oriental sayings as plant melons , you ' ll get melons  plant beans , you ' ll get beans .  do not be misled  god is not one to be mocked .  for whatever a person is sowing , this he will also reap . 
many think that those who are well - educated and rich have a secure future .  they believe that a university education can help a person become a better worker , a better family member , and a better citizen .  they may also feel that a good education will lead to a better - paying job and that those who make a lot of money will be happy .  consider the comments made by zhang chen , who is from china .  he says ,  i believed that i needed a university degree to get out of poverty and that a high - paying job would guarantee a happy and satisfying life .  to improve their chances of gaining a secure future , many are eager to attend famous universities , perhaps in other countries .  parents often make great sacrifices so that their children can attend university overseas .  qixiang , from taiwan , recalls   my parents were not well - off , but they sent all four of us children to college in the united states .  to pay for such education , his family , like many others , had to go deep into debt .  many who pursued advanced education and wealth are left frustrated education can improve life in some ways , but it does not always bring the results that students expect .  for example , after years of sacrifice and incurring significant debt , many cannot find the job they wanted .  a report by rachel mui in singapore ' s business times says   graduate unemployment appears to be a growing issue .  jianjie , a doctorate holder who lives in taiwan , says ,  many have no choice but to accept a job that has nothing to do with their degree .  those who can obtain a job in their chosen profession may still find that their life has not turned out as they had hoped .  after returning from university in the united kingdom , niran , who is from thailand , found a job in his field .  as i expected , the degree helped me to get a job with a higher salary .  however , the higher salary demanded more work and more time from me .  eventually , the company laid off most of its employees , including me .  i realized that there is no security in any job .  even those who are rich or have achieved the so - called good life still face family problems , health tragedies , and economic uncertainty .  katsutoshi , from japan , admits ,  i enjoyed many material things , but i was frustrated by competition , jealousy , and bullying .  lam , a woman who lives in vietnam , says ,  i see many people strive for a well - paying job to obtain financial security , but in reality , it has the opposite effect  insecurity , health disorders , emotional exhaustion , and depression .  to be sure , people need a basic education and money to provide for themselves and their family .  however , these are not enough to guarantee a secure future .  consider what the holy writings say .  higher education does not always bring success .  the swift do not always win the race , .  nor do the intelligent always have the riches , nor do those with knowledge always have success , because time and unexpected events overtake them all .  those who seem most qualified to succeed often do not , and usually for reasons they cannot control .  economic instability , social injustice , and prejudice can prevent even the best educated people from doing what they want to do .  wealth may not last .  do not wear yourself out to gain wealth .  stop and show understanding .  when you cast your eyes on it , it is not there , for it will surely sprout wings like an eagle and fly off into the sky .  any security that money provides is temporary .  upheavals in the financial world can wipe out a person ' s life savings overnight .  natural disasters , such as earthquakes , wildfires , and cyclones , can leave a person bankrupt and homeless .  money often brings problems .  the plenty belonging to the rich one does not permit him to sleep .  franklin , who lives in hong kong , experienced the truthfulness of that wise saying .  he had advanced education and a well - paying job .  then he was promoted to be a manager .  the stress began to affect my health ,  he said .  i worried so much that i could not sleep .  eventually he reached a breaking point .  i started to question why i was doing this ,  he recalled ,  and it led me to think more about the purpose of life .  do not wear yourself out to gain wealth .  rather than focus their life on material things , some seek a better future by striving to be a good person and to do good to others .  will pursuing such a way of life guarantee a secure future .  the next article offers the answer .  i have seen something further under the sun , that the swift do not always win the race , nor do the mighty win the battle , nor do the wise always have the food , nor do the intelligent always have the riches , nor do those with knowledge always have success , because time and unexpected events  overtake them all .  or  unforeseen occurrence .  do not wear yourself out to gain wealth .  stop and show understanding .  or possibly ,  cease from your own understanding .  sweet is the sleep of the one serving , whether he eats little or much , but the plenty belonging to the rich one does not permit him to sleep .  do not wear yourself out to gain wealth .  stop and show understanding .  or possibly ,  cease from your own understanding . 
for centuries , many people have felt that being a good and moral person is the way to a secure future .  for example , people in the orient respected what the philosopher - teacher confucius   said   what you do not want done to yourself , do not do to others .  many still believe that proper behavior is the key to a secure future .  they try to be respectful , cultivate good manners , recognize their place in society , and maintain a good conscience .  i always believed that if i was honest and sincere ,  says linh , a woman in vietnam ,  i would be blessed in return .  some are motivated by their religious beliefs to do good .  a man named hsu - yun , who lives in taiwan , says ,  i was taught that a person ' s deeds while he is alive will determine whether he will enjoy endless bliss or suffer torment after he dies .  it is true that when we do good to others , we enjoy many benefits .  however , many who sincerely try to be good to others find that doing so does not always lead to what they might expect .  i learned firsthand that those who do good are not always blessed in return ,  says a woman named shiu ping , who lives in hong kong .  i tried my best to care for my family and to do good .  but my marriage failed and my husband abandoned me and my son .  many have seen that religion has not always made people better .  i got involved in a religious organization and became a director of youth activities ,  says etsuko , a woman who lives in japan .  i was shocked to see the loose morals , power struggles , and dishonest use of funds by those involved in my religion .  i tried my best to care for my family and to do good .  but my marriage failed and my husband abandoned me and my son .  shiu ping , hong kong some who are devout have felt disappointed when their good deeds went unrewarded .  that was how van , a woman from vietnam , felt .  every day i bought fruits , flowers , and food and offered them on the altars of my dead ancestors , hoping that i would enjoy blessings in the future ,  she says .  despite all the good deeds and religious rituals that i had performed for many years , my husband was struck with a debilitating disease .  then , while my daughter was studying abroad , she passed away at a young age .  being a good person is important , but it is not enough to guarantee a secure future .  consider what the holy writings tell us .  not everyone chooses to do good  just one sinner can destroy much good .  even if you try very hard to be a good person , your future can be threatened by the selfish actions of others .  for example , during a pandemic you may follow the advice of the authorities and avoid close contact with others .  but what if some refuse to cooperate .  their conduct could undermine the health of those who try to do what is right .  people can be mistaken about what is good or bad  there is a way that seems right to a man , but in the end it leads to death .  history is full of examples of people who pursued a course that they were convinced was good , only to find out that they were wrong .  good intentions do not shield someone from the consequences of bad decisions .  life is unpredictable  you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow .  no matter how virtuous a person may be , his life can be cut short .  or consider the experience of liting , a woman in china who lost her father in a car accident .  she says   i couldn ' t understand how such a kind person could die .  my father was hardworking , down - to - earth , and sincere .  he was the only one in the vehicle who was killed .  if being a good person offers no assurance of a secure future , what does .  to answer this question , we need a reliable guide  a source of information that can answer our questions and point the way to a secure future .  where can we find such a guide .  wisdom is better than weapons of war , but just one sinner can destroy much good .  there is a way that seems right to a man , but in the end it leads to death .  whereas you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow .  for you are a mist that appears for a little while and then disappears . 
as discussed in the preceding articles , people have tried to find a better future by putting their trust in such things as fate , education , wealth , and being a good person .  taking these approaches , however , is like using a faulty map to get to a destination .  does that mean there is no reliable guide for the future .  when making decisions , we usually consult someone who is older and wiser than we are .  in a similar way , we can find sound guidance for our future from a source who is far older and wiser than we are .  this collection of holy writings is a book called the bible .  why can you trust the bible .  because its author is the oldest and wisest person in the universe .  he is described as  the ancient of days  who is  from everlasting to everlasting .  he is  the creator of the heavens , the true god , the one who formed the earth .  he identifies himself by his personal name , jehovah .  because the bible is from the creator of all mankind , it does not favor one culture or race over another .  its counsel is timeless and has benefited people in all lands .  it is available in more languages and has been more widely distributed than any other book .  this means that people everywhere can easily understand it and be guided by it .  these facts support the bible ' s own statement   god is not partial , but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him .  just as a caring parent provides guidance for his children , jehovah god is a loving father who offers us help through his word , the bible .  you can trust his word  after all , he made us and knows what course of life is best for us .  events  nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .  there will be great earthquakes , and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences .  behavior  in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here .  for men will be lovers of themselves , lovers of money , boastful , haughty , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , disloyal , having no natural affection , not open to any agreement , slanderers , without self - control , fierce , without love of goodness , betrayers , headstrong , puffed up with pride , lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of god .  what do you conclude when you see that the bible so long ago accurately described what is happening today .  no doubt you will agree with leung , from hong kong , who says   bible prophecies were written long ago .  it is impossible for any human to have predicted these things so accurately .  the bible has to be inspired by someone far superior to us .  the bible contains hundreds of prophecies that have been fulfilled .  these prove that the bible really is god ' s word .  i am god , and there is no one like me ,  says jehovah .  from the beginning i foretell the outcome .  with good reason , therefore , you can rely on what the bible says about the future .  when you follow the guidance found in the holy scriptures , you benefit yourself .  consider some examples .  balanced view of money and work  better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind .  family life  each one of you must love his wife as he does himself  on the other hand , the wife should have deep respect for her husband .  human relations  let go of anger and abandon rage  do not become upset and turn to doing evil .  applying what the bible says benefits you now and also opens up to you a bright future .  in the bible , we find god ' s promise of a wonderful future that includes peace and security  they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace .  housing and food for all  they will build houses and live in them , and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage .  no more sickness or death  death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore .  what do you need to do to be assured of such a future .  consider the next article .  org and look under bible teachings   history   the bible .  published by jehovah ' s witnesses .  it is available online at www .  look under library   books   brochures .  i kept watching until thrones were set in place and the ancient of days sat down .  his clothing was white like snow , and the hair of his head was like clean wool .  his throne was flames of fire  its wheels were a burning fire .  before the mountains were born or you brought forth  the earth and the productive land , from everlasting to everlasting ,  you are god .  or  brought forth as with labor pains .  or  from eternity to eternity .  for this is what jehovah says , the creator of the heavens , the true god , the one who formed the earth , its maker who firmly established it , who did not create it simply for nothing ,  but formed it to be inhabited   i am jehovah , and there is no one else .  or possibly ,  to be empty .  may people know that you , whose name is jehovah , you alone are the most high over all the earth .  all scripture is inspired of god and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight ,  for disciplining in righteousness ,  or  correcting .  then he said to them   nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .  but know this , that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here .  i am god , and there is no one like me .  i say ,  my decision  will stand , and i will do whatever i please .  or  the divine one .  or  purpose  counsel .  better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind .  nevertheless , each one of you must love his wife as he does himself  on the other hand , the wife should have deep respect for her husband .  let go of anger and abandon rage  do not become upset and turn to doing evil .  or possibly ,  do not become upset , for it can only lead to harm .  but the meek will possess the earth , and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace .  they will build houses and live in them , and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage .  and he will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore .  the former things have passed away .
