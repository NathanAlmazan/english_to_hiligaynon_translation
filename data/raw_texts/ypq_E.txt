imagine this scenario  karen is at a party for no more than ten minutes when she hears a familiar voice behind her .  why are you just standing there .  karen turns to see her friend jessica clutching two freshly opened bottles .  she can tell that they contain alcohol .  jessica holds one bottle right in front of karen ' s face and says ,  you ' re not too young to have a little fun , are you .  karen wants to refuse , but jessica is her friend .  and karen doesn ' t want her friend to think she is boring .  besides , jessica is one of the good girls .  and if she ' s drinking , then it must not be so bad .  it ' s just a drink , '  karen tells herself .  it ' s not like taking drugs .   '  if you were in karen ' s situation , what would you do .  to make a wise decision in this type of situation , you need an identity .  an identity is an inner sense that tells you who you are and what you stand for .  armed with that knowledge , you ' re empowered to control your life instead of letting others control it for you .  how can you develop that kind of strength .  answering the following questions is a good start .  knowing your abilities and positive traits will boost your confidence .  bible example  the apostle paul wrote   even if i am unskilled in speech , i certainly am not in knowledge .  with his thorough grasp of the scriptures , paul was able to remain firm when others challenged him .  he didn ' t let their negative remarks weaken his confidence .  analyze yourself  write down a talent or a skill that you possess .  now describe a strong quality that you have .  just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link , your identity can quickly change for the worse if you let your weaknesses control your life .  bible example  paul was aware of his weaknesses .  he wrote   i really delight in the law of god according to the man i am within , but i see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin ' s law .  analyze yourself  what weakness do you need to learn to control .  would you get into a taxi and tell the driver to circle the block repeatedly until his car ran out of fuel .  that would be foolish  and costly .  goals give your life direction and keep you from going in circles .  you have somewhere to go and a plan of how to get there .  bible example  paul wrote   the way i am running is not aimlessly .  rather than drift through life letting things happen to him , paul set goals and then lived in accord with them .  analyze yourself  write down three goals that you would like to reach within the next year .  when you have a strong identity , you are like a firmly rooted tree that can withstand powerful storms without convictions , you ' ll be indecisive .  like a chameleon , you ' ll change colors to blend in with your peers  a sure sign that you don ' t have your own identity .  in contrast , when your actions are based on your convictions , you maintain your identity  regardless of what others do .  bible example  while likely still a teenager , the prophet daniel  resolved in his heart  that he would obey god ' s laws , even though he was separated from his family .  by doing so , he stayed true to himself .  daniel lived according to his convictions .  analyze yourself  what are your convictions .  for example  do you believe in god .  what evidence convinces you of his existence .  do you believe that god ' s moral standards are for your own good .  in the end , which would you rather be like  a fallen leaf that gets blown around by every mild breeze or a tree that withstands even powerful storms .  strengthen your identity , and you ' ll be like that tree .  and that will help you answer the question , who am i .  for each goal , write down one step you can take this month toward meeting it .  or  disqualified .  but even if i am unskilled in speech , i certainly am not in knowledge  indeed we made it clear to you in every way and in everything .  for they say   his letters are weighty and forceful , but his presence in person is weak and his speech contemptible .  for i consider that i have not proved inferior to your superfine apostles in a single thing .  therefore , the way i am running is not aimlessly  the way i am aiming my blows is so as not to be striking the air       not that i have already received it or am already made perfect , but i am pressing on to see if i may also lay hold on that for which christ jesus selected me .   ,  laid hold on me .  but daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king ' s delicacies or with the wine he drank .  so he asked the principal court official for permission not to defile himself in this way . 
imagine this scenario  when julia looks in the mirror , all she sees is fat .  i need to lose weight ,  she tells herself  even though her parents and friends tell her she ' s  stick - thin .  recently , julia has thought about taking extreme measures to lose  just five pounds .  all she has to do is starve herself for a few days .  if you felt the way julia does , what would you do .  your perception of yourself can be like a reflection in a distorted mirror it ' s not wrong for you to be concerned about how you look .  in fact , the bible comments favorably on the physical appearance of a number of women and men , including sarah , rachel , abigail , joseph , and david .  the bible says that a woman named abishag was  extremely beautiful .  however , many youths are obsessed with how they look .  that can lead to severe problems .  in their quest to lose weight , some youths have fallen victim to anorexia  a life - threatening eating disorder that really amounts to self - starvation .  if you have symptoms of anorexia or any other eating disorder , get help .  start by confiding in a parent or another trusted adult .  the bible says   a true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress .  really , it ' s the inner person that makes one either attractive or not .  consider king david ' s son absalom .  the bible says   no man was as highly praised for his handsome appearance .  there was no flaw in him .  yet , this young man was full of pride , ambition , and treachery .  the bible , therefore , doesn ' t paint a pretty picture of absalom  it portrays him as a man of shameless disloyalty and murderous hatred .  for good reason , the bible gives us this advice   clothe yourselves with the new personality .  do not let your adornment be external .   , but let it be the secret person of the heart .  while there ' s nothing wrong with wanting to look good , far more important than your appearance is your personality .  in the long run , praiseworthy qualities will make you more attractive to others than a strong body or a beautiful figure will .  prettiness can get quick attention ,  says a girl named phylicia ,  but who you are on the inside and your good qualities are what people will remember about you the most .  are you often disappointed with the way you look .  have you ever considered resorting to cosmetic surgery or an extreme diet to correct a physical flaw .  what would you change about your appearance if you could .  height   weight   hair   body shape   face   complexion if you answered yes to the first two questions and selected three or more features in the third , consider this  there ' s a good chance that others don ' t see you as negatively as you see yourself .  it ' s easy to go to extremes and worry about your appearance too much .  how can i take better care of my health .  for me , what would a reasonable exercise program include .  if a friend confides in me that she is taking drastic measures to lose weight , what will i do .  watch the video what your peers say  body image at www .  the girl was extremely beautiful , and she became the king ' s nurse and waited on him , but the king did not have sexual relations with her .  a true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress .  now in all israel , no man was as highly praised for his handsome appearance as ab sa lom .  from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head , there was no flaw in him .  and clothe yourselves with the new personality , which through  accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the one who created it ,  or  in .  but jehovah said to samuel   do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is , for i have rejected him .  for the way man sees is not the way god sees , because mere man sees what appears to the eyes , but jehovah sees into the heart . 
imagine this scenario  it ' s wednesday night .  he turns on the tv and collapses into his favorite chair .  at that moment , dad appears in the doorway , and he isn ' t happy .  why are you wasting your time watching tv when you ' re supposed to be helping your little brother with his homework .  you never do as you ' re told .  here we go again ,  geoff mutters , loud enough to be heard .  dad leans forward .  what did you say , young man .  nothing , dad ,  geoff says with a sigh , rolling his eyes .  now dad is really angry .  don ' t use that tone with me .  he says sternly .  if you were geoff , how might you have prevented this confrontation .  communicating with your parents is like driving a car .  if you encounter a roadblock , you can find another route .  for example   i find it difficult to communicate with my father ,  says a girl named leah .  sometimes i ' ll talk to him for a while , and then he ' ll say ,  i ' m sorry , were you speaking to me .   '   leah has at least three options .  yell at her dad .  leah screams ,  come on , this is important .  stop talking to her dad .  leah simply gives up trying to talk to her dad about her problem .  wait for a better time , and bring up the subject again .  leah speaks with her dad face - to - face later , or she writes him a letter about her problem .  which option would you recommend to leah .  consider  leah ' s dad is distracted  and thus unaware of her frustration .  so if leah chooses option a , her screaming might seem to come out of nowhere .  this option probably won ' t make leah ' s dad more receptive to her words , and it won ' t show respect and honor for him .  really , then , this option will not benefit anyone .  just as you need not let a roadblock be a dead end , you can find a way to get through to your parents while option b may be the easiest course to take , it ' s not the wisest .  because to deal successfully with her problems , leah needs to talk to her dad  and if he ' s going to help her , he needs to know what ' s going on in her life .  silence accomplishes neither .  with option c , however , leah doesn ' t let a roadblock become a dead end .  rather , she tries to discuss the subject another time .  and if she chooses to write her dad a letter , leah might feel better right away .  writing the letter may also help her to formulate exactly what she wants to say .  when he reads the letter , leah ' s dad will learn what she was trying to tell him , which may help him to understand her plight better .  option c thus benefits both leah and her dad .  whether face - to - face or with a letter , this option follows the bible ' s admonition to  pursue the things making for peace .  what other options might leah have .  see if you can think of one .  then think of where that option would likely lead .  honor your father and your mother .  let your words always be gracious .  be quick to listen , slow to speak , slow to anger .  remember , what you said and what your parents think you said do not always match .  for example  your parents ask you why you seem to be in a bad mood .  you say ,  i don ' t want to talk about it .  but your parents hear   i don ' t trust you enough to confide in you .  i ' ll talk to my friends about the problem but not to you .  imagine that you are facing a difficult problem and your parent offers to help .  but you say   don ' t worry .  i can handle it myself .  what might your parents hear .  what might be a better response from you .  the next time i don ' t feel like talking to my parents , what will i do .  if my parent forces me to talk about a subject that i am reluctant to discuss , what will i do .  honor your father and your mother  is the first command with a promise       so , then , let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that build one another up .  honor your father and your mother  is the first command with a promise       let your words always be gracious , seasoned with salt , so that you will know how you should answer each person .  know this , my beloved brothers  everyone must be quick to listen , slow to speak , slow to anger , . 
imagine this scenario  while playing with his friends , tim throws a ball that crashes through a neighbor ' s window .  if you were tim , what would you do .  you have three options                run .  blame someone else .  tell the neighbor what happened , and offer to pay for the damages .  you could be tempted to select option a .  but there are always good reasons for you to admit your mistakes  whether they involve a broken window or anything else .  it ' s the right thing to do .  the bible says   we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things .  people are more likely to forgive those who admit their mistakes .  the bible says   the one covering over his transgressions will not succeed , but whoever confesses and abandons them will be shown mercy .  most important , it pleases god .  the bible says   jehovah detests a devious person , but his close friendship is with the upright .  but she couldn ' t keep it hidden forever .  about a year later ,  karina says ,  my dad noticed a speeding ticket under my name .  i got into so much trouble .  lesson learned .  karina says   keeping mistakes a secret only makes things worse .  you still pay for them later on .  the bible says   we all make mistakes many times .  and as we have seen , it is a sign of humility and maturity to admit your mistakes  and to do so right away .  the next step is to learn from your mistakes .  a girl named vera says   i try to view each mistake as a learning experience and let it be a lesson that will help me to be a better person and handle the situation differently the next time .  let ' s see how you can do that .  you borrow your father ' s bike and damage it .  what would you do next .  say nothing and hope your dad doesn ' t notice .  tell your dad exactly what happened .  tell your dad what happened but blame someone else .  you fail a test because you did not study for it .  what would you do next .  blame the test .  accept responsibility for your failing grade .  claim that the teacher has something against you .  dwelling on past mistakes is like staring in the rearview mirror while driving a car now look back at the preceding scenarios , and try to imagine that you are   your dad and   your teacher .  what would your dad and your teacher think of you if you readily admitted your mistakes .  what would they think of you if you covered up your mistakes .  now think about a mistake that you made during the past year and answer the following questions .  what was the mistake .  how did you handle that mistake .  i covered it up .  i blamed someone else for it .  i readily admitted it .  if you didn ' t admit your mistake , how did you feel afterward .  great  i got away with it .  guilty  i should have told the truth .  how could you have handled the situation better .  what did you learn from your mistake .  why do some people hold back from admitting their mistakes .  what will people think of you if you always try to cover up your mistakes , but what will they think of you if you admit your mistakes .  keep praying for us , for we trust we have an honest  conscience , as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things .  the one covering over his transgressions will not succeed , but whoever confesses and abandons them will be shown mercy .  for jehovah detests a devious person , but his close friendship is with the upright .  for we all stumble  many times .  if anyone does not stumble in word , he is a perfect man , able to bridle also his whole body .  or  make mistakes .  the person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much , and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much . 
imagine this scenario  thomas doesn ' t want to go to school today .  or tomorrow .  or ever again .  it all started three months ago when his schoolmates spread vicious rumors about him .  then came the nicknames .  sometimes someone will knock thomas '  textbooks out of his hands and act as if it were an accident , or one person in a group behind him will shove him , and by the time thomas turns around , he can ' t tell who did it .  yesterday , the bullying took an even more sinister turn when thomas received an online threat .  if you were thomas , how would you respond .  you are not totally powerless .  in fact , you can fight a bully without using your fists .  don ' t react .  the bible says   a stupid person gives vent to all his feelings , but the wise one calmly keeps them in check .  if you remain as calm as possible  at least on the outside  those bullying you may well lose interest .  don ' t retaliate .  the bible says   return evil for evil to no one .  seeking revenge will only make the situation worse .  don ' t walk into trouble .  the bible says   the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself .  to the extent possible , avoid people who could cause trouble , and avoid situations where bullying may occur .  try an unexpected response .  the bible says   a mild answer turns away rage .  you can even try humor .  for example , if a bully asserts that you ' re overweight , you could shrug your shoulders and say ,  i guess i could lose a few pounds .  it demonstrates self - control  something the bully doesn ' t have .  work on your self - confidence .  bullies can often detect those who think negatively of themselves and who are thus not likely to fight back .  in contrast , many bullies will back off if they see that you aren ' t giving them any power over you .  tell someone .  a former schoolteacher says   i would urge anyone who is being bullied to speak up .  it ' s the right thing to do , and it can prevent someone else from being bullied .  self - confidence will give you a power that the bully does not possess besides physical assaults , bullying can also include  verbal attacks .  i ' ll never forget the names they called me or the things they said .  they made me feel worthless , unwanted , and good - for - nothing .  i ' d rather have been given a black eye .  social isolation .  my schoolmates started to avoid me .  they would make it seem that there was no room at the lunch table , so i couldn ' t sit with them .  for the whole year , i cried and ate alone .  cyberbullying .  with just a few keystrokes on a computer , you can ruin someone ' s reputation  or even his life .  it sounds like an overstatement , but it can happen .  for example , the bible tells of the nephilim  a group whose name means  those who cause others to fall down .  it ' s not that serious .  bullying is a contributing factor in a large number of youth suicides .  bullies are often physically stronger than their victims , so attempts at retaliation are futile .  in this case , there ' s no such thing as an innocent bystander .  if you see bullying and don ' t say anything , you may become part of the problem rather than part of the solution .  although some bullies have a big ego , many are insecure and put others down to make themselves feel better .  with help , bullies can change the way they think and act .  if i am confronted by a bully , what will i do or say .  watch the whiteboard animation beat a bully without using your fists at www .  a stupid person gives vent to all his feelings ,  but the wise one calmly keeps them in check .  return evil for evil to no one .  take into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of all men .  the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself , but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences .  or  penalty .  a mild  answer turns away rage , but a harsh  word stirs up anger .  or  painful .  for a slave of the lord does not need to fight , but needs to be gentle  toward all , qualified to teach , showing restraint when wronged ,  or  tactful .  the neph i lim  were on the earth in those days and afterward .  during that time the sons of the true god continued to have relations with the daughters of men , and these bore sons to them .  they were the mighty ones of old times , the men of fame .  possibly meaning  the fellers ,  that is , those who cause others to fall down .  see glossary . 
imagine this scenario  as two of his schoolmates approach , brian feels a knot in his stomach .  twice already this week , they ' ve tried to get him to smoke .  this will be their third attempt .  the first boy speaks   all alone again .  let me introduce you to a friend .  he underscores the word  friend  with a wink as he takes something out of his pocket and extends his hand toward brian .  brian sees the cigarette between the boy ' s thumb and forefinger .  the knot in brian ' s stomach gets even tighter .  sorry ,  brian says .  i ' ve already told you that i don ' t .  the second boy interrupts   don ' t be such a coward .  brian summons the courage to say .  the second boy places his arm around brian ' s shoulder .  just take it ,  he says softly .  the first boy moves the cigarette closer to brian ' s face and adds in a whisper   we won ' t tell anyone .  no one will ever know .  if you were brian , how would you respond .  have brian ' s peers really thought about what they are doing .  have they made their own decisions .  in general , they have yielded to the influence of others .  they want to be accepted , so they allow others to shape what they do .  if you were confronted with the same situation , how could you choose a different path and resist peer pressure .  anticipate the bible says   the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself , but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences .  often , you can see trouble in advance .  for example , suppose you see a group of your schoolmates up ahead , and they ' re smoking .  by anticipating a problem , you ' ll be ready to deal with it .  think the bible says   maintain a good conscience .  ask yourself ,  how will i feel in the long run if i go along with the crowd .   '  true , you might temporarily avoid the disapproval of your peers .  but how will you feel later .  are you willing to sacrifice your identity just to please your classmates .  decide the bible says   the wise one is cautious .  sooner or later , we have to make a choice and live with the consequences .  the bible tells of men like joseph , job , and jesus , who all made the right choice .  it also tells of cain , esau , and judas , who made bad choices .  what will you do .  the bible says   act with faithfulness .  if you ' ve already thought about the consequences and made up your mind , stating your position can be surprisingly easy  and rewarding .  don ' t worry  you don ' t have to give your peers a lecture .  a simple but firm no may suffice .  or to make your nonnegotiable stand clear , you could say   count me out .  i don ' t do that sort of thing .  come on , you know me better than that .  the key is to respond promptly and with conviction .  if you do , you might be surprised at how quickly your peers will back off .  if you yield to pressure from your peers , you become like a robot that is under their control what if your peers mock you .  what if they say ,  what ' s wrong  are you a coward .  recognize this sort of taunt for what it is  crude peer pressure .  how can you respond .  you have at least two options .  you could absorb the taunt .  you could return the pressure .  state your reason for refusing , and then appeal to your peers '  intellect .  if your peers continue to taunt you , walk away .  remember , the longer you stay , the more intense the pressure will become .  by leaving the scene , you show that you refuse to let others change who you are .  realistically , you can ' t hide from peer pressure .  but you can decide what you want to do , state your position , and take control .  in the end , the choice is yours .  how can i prepare myself to resist peer pressure .  if my peers try to pressure me into wrong conduct , what will i do .  watch the whiteboard animation stand up to peer pressure .  the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself , but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences .  or  penalty .  maintain a good conscience , so that in whatever way you are spoken against , those who speak against you may be put to shame because of your good conduct as followers of christ .  you must not follow after the crowd to do evil , and you must not pervert justice by giving testimony to go along with the crowd .  or  testimony that is popular .  the wise one is cautious and turns away from evil , but the stupid one is reckless  and overconfident .  or  furious .  trust in jehovah and do what is good  reside in the earth ,  and act with faithfulness .  now if it seems bad to you to serve jehovah , choose for yourselves today whom you will serve , whether the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the river  or the gods of the am or ites in whose land you are dwelling .  but as for me and my household , we will serve jehovah .  that is , the euphrates . 
imagine this scenario  heather has been seeing mike for only two months , but she feels as if she ' s known him forever .  they text each other constantly , they talk for hours at a time on the phone , and they can even finish each other ' s sentences .  but now mike wants more than conversation .  during the past two months , mike and heather have done nothing more than hold hands and briefly kiss .  heather doesn ' t want to go further .  but she doesn ' t want to lose mike either .  no one makes her feel so beautiful , so special .  besides , '  she tells herself ,  mike and i are in love .   '  if you are old enough to date and you were in heather ' s situation , what would you do next .  sex is a gift from god for married persons only .  premarital sex is an abuse of that gift .  it ' s like taking a beautiful garment someone gave you and using it as a cleaning cloth if you defy a physical law , such as the law of gravity , you will suffer the consequences .  the same is true if you defy a moral law , such as the one that states   abstain from sexual immorality .  what are the consequences of disobeying that command .  the bible says   whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body .  how is that true .  researchers have found that many youths who have had premarital sex usually experience one or more of the following consequences .  most youths who have engaged in premarital sex say that they regretted it afterward .  after having sex , each partner begins to wonder ,  who else has he  she had sex with .   '  disillusionment .  deep down , many girls would prefer someone who will protect them , not take advantage of them .  and many boys find that they are less attracted to a girl who has given in to their advances .  the bottom line  if you give in to premarital sex , you degrade yourself by forfeiting something precious .  your body is far too valuable to give away .  show that you have the strength of character to  abstain from sexual immorality .  then , if you do marry one day , you can have sex .  and you ' ll be able to enjoy it fully , without the worries , regrets , and insecurities that are so often part of the aftermath of premarital sex .  would anyone who truly loves you endanger your physical and emotional well - being .  would anyone who truly cares for you tempt you to jeopardize your relationship with god .  a number of boys have said that they would never marry a girl they have had sex with .  because they prefer someone who is chaste .  does that surprise you  perhaps even anger you .  then remember this  movies and tv shows glamorize teen sex and make it look like harmless fun or even true love .  but don ' t be naive .  those who would try to coax you into premarital sex are only looking out for their own interests .  if you are dating , ask yourself ,  do i really care for my girlfriend .   '  if your answer is yes , how can you best show it .  by having the strength to uphold god ' s laws , the wisdom to avoid tempting circumstances , and the love to look out for her interests .  if you have such qualities , then likely your girlfriend ' s feelings will be similar to those of the morally upright shulammite who said   my dear one is mine and i am his .  in short , she will love you even more .  if someone tries to coax you into sex by saying ,  if you love me , you ' ll do this ,  firmly reply ,  if you love me , you won ' t ask .  when it comes to conduct with the opposite sex , a good rule to follow is this  if it ' s something you wouldn ' t want your parents to see you doing , you shouldn ' t be doing it .  how will you respond if someone asks you to have sex .  what circumstances would make it more difficult for you to say no .  how will you avoid those circumstances .  for this is the will of god , that you should be holy and abstain from sexual immorality .  greek , por nei a .  see glossary .  flee from sexual immorality .  every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body , but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body .  therefore , god , in keeping with the desires of their hearts , gave them up to uncleanness , so that their bodies might be dishonored among them .  for this is the will of god , that you should be holy and abstain from sexual immorality .  greek , por nei a .  see glossary .  or  fetters .  let the husband give to his wife her due , and let the wife also do likewise to her husband .  let marriage be honorable among all , and let the marriage bed be without defilement , for god will judge sexually immoral people  and adulterers .  see glossary ,  sexual immorality .  love is patient and kind .  love is not jealous .  it does not keep account of the injury .  my dear one is mine and i am his .  he is shepherding among the lilies . 
annette ' s attacker threw her to the ground before she realized what was happening .  i tried everything i could to fight him off ,  she says .  i tried to scream , but only air escaped my lungs .  i pushed , kicked , punched , and scratched .  and that ' s when i felt a knife pierce my skin .  i went completely limp .  if you were in a situation like that , how would you react .  while you might be prepared  perhaps by being alert when you travel outdoors at night  bad things can happen .  the swift do not always win the race ,  says the bible ,  nor do those with knowledge always have success , because time and unexpected events overtake them all .  some youths , like annette , are assaulted by a stranger .  others are attacked by an acquaintance or even a family member .  at just ten years of age , natalie was sexually abused by a teenager who lived near her home .  i was so scared and ashamed that at first i didn ' t tell anyone ,  she says .  annette still deals with feelings of guilt over what happened .  i keep playing that night over and over again in my head ,  she says .  i feel as though i should have tried harder to fight him off .  the fact is , after being stabbed , i was paralyzed with fear .  i couldn ' t do anything more , but i feel that i should have .  natalie also struggles with feelings of guilt .  i shouldn ' t have been so trusting ,  she says .  my parents had a rule that my sister and i had to stay together when we played outside , but i didn ' t listen .  so i feel i gave my neighbor the opportunity to hurt me .  what happened affected my family , and i feel responsible for causing them so much pain .  i struggle with that the most .  if your feelings are similar to those of annette or natalie , keep foremost in mind that a person who is raped is not a willing participant .  some people make the issue seem less serious , using the excuse that it is normal for boys to act that way or that victims of rape were asking for it .  but no one deserves to be raped .  if you were the victim of such a heinous act , you are not to blame .  of course , reading the statement  you are not to blame  is easy  believing it may be much more difficult .  some hold in their feelings about what happened and suffer from guilt and other negative emotions .  but who is best served by silence  you or the abuser .  you owe it to yourself to consider another option .  the bible tells us that at the height of his personal turmoil , the righteous man job said   i will speak out in my bitter distress .  you may benefit from doing the same .  talking to a trusted confidant can help you to come to terms with what happened and help you to gain relief from overwhelming emotions .  your feelings might be too heavy for you to carry by yourself .  why not get help by talking to someone about them .  annette found that to be true .  she says   i talked to a close friend , and she urged me to speak with a couple of christian elders in my congregation .  i ' m glad i did .  they sat down with me on several occasions and told me exactly what i needed to hear  that what happened was not my fault .  none of it was my fault .  natalie talked to her parents about the abuse .  they supported me ,  she says .  they encouraged me to talk about it , and that helped me not to be so sad and angry inside .  natalie also found comfort in prayer .  talking to god helped me ,  she says ,  especially at those times when i felt that i couldn ' t open up to another human .  when i pray , i can speak freely .  it gives me a real sense of peace and calm .  you too can find that there is  a time to heal .  take care of yourself physically and emotionally .  get needed rest .  and most of all , rely on the god of all comfort , jehovah .  if you are a girl and you are being pressured to engage in unclean conduct , there ' s nothing wrong with firmly stating ,  don ' t do that .  or ,  take your hand off me .  don ' t hold back out of fear that you ' ll lose your boyfriend .  if he breaks up with you over this issue , he ' s not worth keeping .  you deserve a real man , one who respects your body and your principles .  in middle school , boys would pull on the back of my bra and make derogatory comments  like how much better i would feel once i had sex with them .  do you think that those boys were

if creation is true , we can find satisfying answers to questions about life and the future .  imagine this scenario  alex is confused .  he has always believed in god and in creation .  but today his biology teacher forcefully claimed that evolution is a fact , that it is based on credible scientific research .  alex doesn ' t want to appear foolish .  after all , '  he says to himself ,  if scientists have proved evolution to be true , who am i to question them .   '  if you were alex , would you accept evolution just because the textbooks present it as fact .  people on both sides of the debate are often quick to state what they believe without really knowing why they believe it .  some people believe in creation simply because that ' s what they ' ve been taught at church .  some people believe in evolution simply because that ' s what they ' ve been taught at school .  the bible says   every house is constructed by someone , but the one who constructed all things is god .  is that reasonable to believe .  claiming that life did not have a creator is as absurd as claiming that this house did not have a builder claim  everything in the universe came as a result of a random big bang .  who or what caused the big bang .  which makes more sense  that everything came from nothing or that everything came from someone .  claim  humans evolved from animals .  if humans evolved from animals  from apes , for example  why is there such a huge gap between the intellectual abilities of humans and those of apes .  why are even the most  basic  forms of life so incredibly complex .  claim  evolution is a proven fact .  has the person making this claim investigated the evidence for himself .  how many people believe in evolution simply because they have been told that all intelligent people believe in it .  if you were walking through the forest and discovered a beautiful house , would you think   how fascinating .  the trees must have fallen in just the right way to make this house .   '  of course not .  it ' s just not reasonable .  so why should we believe that everything in the universe just happened to come about .  imagine that someone told you that there was an explosion at a printing plant and that the ink spattered onto the walls and ceilings and formed the text of an unabridged dictionary .  would you believe it .  the bible encourages you to use your  power of reason .  that means your belief in god should not be based merely on emotion   the influence of others   pressure   instead , you should have sound reasons for your belief .  when i ' m in class listening to the teacher explain how our bodies function , there ' s no doubt in my mind that god exists .  each part of the body has its own function , down to the smallest detail , and these functions are often carried out without our awareness .  the human body truly is mind - boggling .  when i see a skyscraper , a cruise ship , or a car , i ask myself ,  who built this .   '  it takes intelligent people to build a car , for example , because so many small components have to work just right for the whole thing to function .  and if cars have to be designed by someone , then so do we humans .  the more i studied science , the less credible evolution seemed .  to me , it takes more  faith '  to believe in evolution than to believe in a creator .  despite decades of research , scientists have yet to come up with an explanation for evolution that they can all agree on .  if scientists can ' t agree on evolution  and they are supposed to be the experts  are you wrong to question the theory .  imagine that a schoolmate says to you   i don ' t believe in god .  write down what you would say .  watch the video what your peers say  belief in god at www .  of course , every house is constructed by someone , but the one who constructed all things is god .  therefore , i appeal to you by the compassions of god , brothers , to present your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to god , a sacred service with your power of reason . 
if this is true , then the bible can give you the direction you need .  imagine this scenario  david is driving in an area where nothing looks familiar .  the street signs and landmarks show that he is not where he should be by now .  david realizes that he is lost .  he must have taken a wrong turn at some point in his journey .  if you were david , what would you do .  you have several options                ask for directions .  consult a map , or use a gps .  keep driving , hoping that somehow you will find your way .  obviously , option c is the least effective .  option b has an advantage over the first .  after all , a map or a gps will be at hand throughout the journey , helping you to guide your course .  the bible can help you in a similar way .  this best - selling book can   guide you through life ' s problems   help you to learn about yourself and become a better person   show you how to have the best life ever from the moment we can talk , we ask questions .  why is the sky blue .  what are the stars made of .  later we begin to ask questions about the world around us .  why do bad things happen .  why do people die .  what if the answers to those questions have been in the bible all along .  many people say that the bible is full of myths and legends , that it ' s outdated , or that it ' s just too hard to understand .  but is the bible really the problem , or is what people have heard about the bible the real problem .  could they be misinformed .  for example , people think that the bible says that god controls the world .  but how could that be .  this world is out of control .  it is full of pain and suffering , sickness and death , poverty and disaster .  how could a loving god be responsible for all of this .  would you like to know the answer .  what the bible says about who controls the world may surprise you .  likely you noticed that the advice found in this brochure is based on the bible .  jehovah ' s witnesses are convinced that the bible is a reliable source of guidance .  that ' s because it is  inspired of god and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight .  you owe it to yourself to examine this ancient  yet modern  book .  watch the video why study the bible .  all scripture is inspired of god and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight ,  for disciplining in righteousness ,  or  correcting .  or  correcting .
