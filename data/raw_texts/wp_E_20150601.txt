has science replaced the bible .  science , according to one dictionary , is  the systematic study of the nature and behaviour of the material and physical universe , based on observation , experiment , and measurement .  to do all of that is hard , often frustrating , work .  scientists struggle with experiments and observations for weeks , months , or even years .  sometimes their labors lead to dead ends , but in many cases they deliver benefits to mankind .  consider a few examples .  a european company has combined strong plastic and advanced filters to produce a device that has made it possible for a person to avoid illness from drinking contaminated water .  high above the earth , networks of satellites make up what is called the global positioning system .  originally designed for military applications , the gps helps motorists , airplane pilots , ship navigators , and even hunters and hikers to find their way .  thanks to the scientists who invented it , the gps makes it easier to get to where you want to go .  do you use a cell phone , a computer , or the internet .  have you seen that your health has improved or has been restored because of advanced medicine .  do you travel by airplane .  if so , you are benefiting from some of the ways in which science has been a boon to humanity .  science has affected your life in many positive ways .  in an effort to expand their horizon , modern scientists are searching deep into the natural world .  nuclear physicists peer into the inner workings of the atom , while astrophysicists trace back billions of years , in an attempt to understand the origin of the universe .  as they probe deep and far , even into realms that are invisible and untouchable , some scientists feel that if the god of the bible exists , they should be able to find him .  some prominent scientists and philosophers go further .  they carry on what science author amir d .  aczel called  a scientific argument against the existence of god .  for example , a world - famous physicist claimed that  the absence of evidence for any god who plays an important role in the universe proves beyond a reasonable doubt that such a god does not exist .  others allude to the activity of the god of the bible as  magic  and  supernatural shenanigans .  however , the question must be asked  has science learned enough about the natural world to be able to draw definitive conclusions .  the simple answer is no .  science has made tremendous progress , but many scientists recognize that there are still many unknowns and perhaps unknowables .  we will never get to the bottom of things ,  said physicist and nobel laureate steven weinberg on understanding nature .  professor martin rees , astronomer royal of great britain , wrote   there may be things that humans will never understand .  the truth is that much of nature , from the tiny cell to the vast universe , still remains beyond the grasp of modern science .  note the following examples               biologists do not fully understand the processes that take place in living cells .  how cells consume energy , how they produce proteins , and how they divide are questions science has not yet completely answered .  gravity affects us every second of every day .  yet it is something of a mystery to physicists .  they do not know fully how gravity pulls you down to the ground when you jump or how it keeps the moon in orbit around the earth .  they divide this strange entity into two categories , dark matter and dark energy .  the nature of these remains unknown .  there are other unknowns that confound scientists .  why is this important .  a popular science writer notes   our knowledge is vastly outstripped by our ignorance .  for me , a life in science prompts awe and exploration over dogmatism .  so if you wonder whether science is about to replace the bible and dispense with belief in god , consider this point  if brilliant scientists with their powerful instruments have been able to gain only limited understanding of the natural world , would it be logical to dismiss out of hand the matters that lie beyond the reaches of science to investigate .  jehovah ' s witnesses respect each person ' s right to make a decision on this matter .  we endeavor to follow the biblical guideline   let your reasonableness become known to all .  it is with that spirit that we invite you to examine how science and the bible harmonize and complement each other .  see the box  the bible and proven scientific facts .  the bible does not claim to be a textbook of scientific knowledge .  its writers , however , did make accurate comments on matters that should interest scientists today .  here are some examples .  the bible sets no date for the creation of the universe .  in no place does it affirm that the earth is only a few thousand years old .  the very first verse in the bible reads   in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth .  that general statement allows scientists to determine the age of the physical world according to sound scientific principles .  the culminating event in this simple description was the appearance of humans .  the bible fixes no duration for the six creative  days .  instead , it opens the door for modern scientists to study them and assign accurate time spans to them .  how the earth is suspended the bible describes the earth as suspended  upon nothing .  there is no mention of our planet resting on the shoulders of a giant or on the backs of elephants that stand on a turtle , as some popular myths of ancient times had it .  rather , the bible leaves the door open to scientific discovery .  in time , nicolaus copernicus and johannes kepler described how the planets move around the sun driven by an invisible force .  isaac newton later showed how gravitation governs the movement of all objects in space .  instructions on disease control and hygiene the book of leviticus contains the instructions given to the israelites on how they were to avoid outbreaks of contagious diseases , including the practice of quarantine .  they had to  cover their excrement '  in the ground .  the bible information that you just read was written down many centuries ago .  how did those writers come up with such accurate information when even the most learned people of their time were ignorant of such things .  the bible ' s author answers   as the heavens are higher than the earth , so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts .  let your reasonableness become known to all men .  the lord is near .  in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth .  in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth .  then there was light .  and there was evening and there was morning , a first day .  and it was so .  and there was evening and there was morning , a second day .  and it was so .  and god saw that it was good .  and it was so .  then god saw that it was good .  and it was so .  then god saw that it was good .  and god saw that it was good .  and it was so .  and god saw that it was good .  let them serve as food for you .  and it was so .  it was very good .  and there was evening and there was morning , a sixth day .  or  the surging waters .  or  god ' s spirit .  or  monsters .  or  moving animals ,  apparently including reptiles and forms of animal life different from the other categories .  or  life as a soul  a living soul .  he stretches out the northern sky  over empty space ,  suspending the earth upon nothing   lit .   ,  the north .   ,  emptiness .  a private place  should be designated for use outside the camp , and there is where you should go .  when you squat outside , you should dig a hole with it and then cover your excrement .  that is , a latrine .  for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts . 
has science replaced the bible .  in recent times , a number of books setting out the views of the so - called new atheists have come into circulation .  these publications have caught the attention of many and have brought about no little discussion and debate .  regarding this , neuroscientist david eagleman wrote   some readers walk away .  with the impression that scientists think they have the big picture solved .  then he added   but good science is always open - minded , and the history of science is one of surprises .  down through the ages , talented scientists have indeed made surprising breakthroughs in their search for answers to puzzling questions about nature .  some , however , have also made serious errors in the process .  isaac newton was one of the greatest scientists of all time .  he showed how the force of gravitation binds the planets , stars , and galaxies into one universe .  he invented calculus , a branch of mathematics used in computer design , space travel , and nuclear physics .  however , newton also pursued alchemy , a pseudoscience that used astrology and magical formulas in attempts to turn lead and other metals into gold .  he tracked the planets across the night sky and was skilled as a mapmaker .  but he believed that the earth was the center of everything .  today scientists face similar challenges in their pursuits .  will they ever find a complete explanation of the universe .  while it is proper to acknowledge the progress science has made and the benefits it has brought us , it is also essential to bear in mind its limitations .  physicist paul davies observed   the search for a closed logical scheme that provides a complete and self - consistent explanation for everything is doomed to failure .  those words state an undeniable truth  humans cannot completely understand the natural world .  so when assertions are made about the potential of science to provide an explanation of everything that exists , it is only reasonable to take such assertions with reservations .  clearly the bible fills our needs in ways that science cannot the bible speaks of the wonders of nature in these words   look .  these are just the fringes of  god ' s  ways  only a faint whisper has been heard of him .  there remains a vast store of knowledge that is beyond human perception and understanding .  how unsearchable his judgments are and beyond tracing out his ways are .  while science offers knowledge of the natural world , the bible provides principles and guidance that lead to peaceful human relations and a happy , satisfying way of life .  consider the following examples .  have regard for life  you must not murder .  everyone who hates his brother is a murderer .  make and keep peace  turn away from what is bad and do what is good  seek peace and pursue it .  the fruit of righteousness is sown in peaceful conditions for those who are making peace .  shun violence  jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one  he hates anyone who loves violence .  do not envy the violent man nor choose any of his ways , for jehovah detests a devious person .  obey your parents  children , be obedient to your parents in union with the lord , for this is righteous .  honor your father and your mother '  is the first command with a promise   that it may go well with you and you may remain a long time on the earth .  teach your children properly  do not be irritating your children , but go on bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of jehovah .  do not be exasperating your children , so that they do not become downhearted .  love and respect your marriage mate  each one of you must love his wife as he does himself  on the other hand , the wife should have deep respect for her husband .  regarding polluters of various kinds in ancient israel , the bible stated   the land has been polluted by its inhabitants .  those inhabiting it are held guilty .  god will hold wanton destroyers of the environment accountable .  he will  bring to ruin those ruining the earth .  they will not get away with their actions .  these are just the fringes of his ways  only a faint whisper has been heard of him .  so who can understand his mighty thunder .  o the depth of god ' s riches and wisdom and knowledge .  how unsearchable his judgments are and beyond tracing out his ways are .  you must not murder .  everyone who hates his brother is a murderer ,  and you know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him .  or  manslayer .  turn away from what is bad and do what is good  seek peace and pursue it .  moreover , the fruit of righteousness is sown in peaceful conditions for  those who are making peace .  or possibly ,  by .  jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one  he  hates anyone who loves violence .  or  his soul  his very being .  children , be obedient to your parents in union with the lord , for this is righteous .  or  that you may prosper .  and fathers , do not be irritating your children , but go on bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of jehovah .  you fathers , do not be exasperating your children , so that they do not become downhearted .  nevertheless , each one of you must love his wife as he does himself  on the other hand , the wife should have deep respect for her husband .  the land has been polluted by its inhabitants , for they have bypassed the laws , changed the regulation , and broken the lasting  covenant .  that is why the inhabitants of the land have dwindled , and very few men are left .  or  ancient .  but the nations became wrathful , and your own wrath came , and the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward your slaves the prophets and the holy ones and those fearing your name , the small and the great , and to bring to ruin those ruining  the earth .  or  to destroy those who are destroying . 
how do you feel when the thought of aging comes up .  it fills many with concern , anxiety , and even dread .  this is because aging is usually associated with negatives , such as diminished looks , a frail body , memory loss , and chronic diseases .  however , the fact is that people differ greatly in the way they age .  some enjoy relatively good health , physically and mentally , in their later years .  advances in medicine have enabled others to treat or control chronic illnesses .  as a result , in some lands more and more people are living longer and healthier lives .  nevertheless , whether confronted with age - related problems or not , most people wish to be able to age gracefully .  how can this be done .  in part , doing so depends on our attitude and our willingness and ability to adapt to this new phase in life .  to help in these areas , let us consider some simple and practical bible principles .  be modest   wisdom is with the modest ones .  in this context ,  the modest ones  can refer to elderly ones who recognize and come to terms with the limitations of their age , not trying to deny or ignore them .  there is no way to turn back the clock .  being modest , however , in no way means adopting the defeatist attitude  i am old , and there is nothing more for me .  such an attitude can sap one of enthusiasm .  instead , a modest person shows wisdom , making the best of a situation .  yes , adjustments need to be made when someone grows older .  corrado and his wife have developed a balanced approach to domestic chores , following a moderately relaxed schedule to avoid feeling completely drained of energy at the end of the day .  i have learned to pace myself ,  she says .  i take short breaks between tasks when necessary .  i sit down or lie down to read or listen to music .  i have learned to recognize and respect my limits .  be balanced be balanced   women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress , with modesty and soundness of mind .  the expression  appropriate dress  denotes balance and good taste .  i don ' t want to look dowdy with that  i ' m old  i don ' t care what i look like '  attitude .  and what can be said about older men .  regarding personal hygiene , he adds   i shower and shave daily .  on the other hand , it is important to avoid becoming concerned about your personal appearance to the point of failing to exercise  soundness of mind .  she says   i am quite aware that it is not appropriate for me to wear some of the clothes that i wore when i was young .  be positive be positive   all the days of the afflicted one are bad , but the one with a cheerful heart has a continual feast .  as you age , you may experience negative feelings when you remember your youthful vigor and the many things you were once able to do .  this is understandable .  however , make an effort not to be overcome by those negative feelings .  dwelling on the past can make your days gloomy and discourage you from doing what you are still able to do .  reading and learning can also make you feel more positive , broadening your horizons .  thus , to the extent possible , be alert for opportunities to read and learn new things .  he says ,  i still enjoy the thrill of adventure , the joy of traveling beyond the confines of home through the written word .  be generous be generous   practice giving , and people will give to you .  make it a practice to share some of your time and resources with others .  this will give you a feeling of accomplishment and happiness .  she says   i call friends who are sick or discouraged and write letters to them .  sometimes i send them little gifts .  i also like to cook a meal or make a dessert for sick ones .  generosity begets generosity .  yes , a generous person creates an atmosphere of warmth and appreciation that others find enjoyable .  be friendly   whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires  he rejects all practical wisdom .  while there are times when you may want to be alone , avoid becoming isolated and withdrawn .  i joyfully associate with people of all ages .  their vitality makes me feel young again  at least on the inside .  take the initiative to invite friends over occasionally .  be friendly friendly people are communicative .  but since communication is a two - way street , you need to make it a point to be good company .  show personal interest in others .  i listen to what they have to say in order to find out what they think and what they like .  when expressing your thoughts , take care to  season your words with salt .   '    be thoughtful and encouraging .  be thankful   show yourselves thankful .  when receiving help , show appreciation for the attention .  expressions of thankfulness help to cultivate good relationships .  my husband and i recently moved from a house to an apartment .  we had dozens of friends helping us .  we could not thank them enough .  she says   i am so grateful for all this help that i make a point of offering some money for the gas .  i sometimes prepare small gifts with thank - you notes .  above all , be thankful for life itself .  a live dog is better off than a dead lion ,  wise king solomon reminded us .  yes , with the right attitude coupled with willingness to adapt , it is possible to age gracefully .  be thankful     when presumptuousness comes , dishonor will follow , but wisdom is with the modest ones .  if you become discouraged in the day of distress ,  your strength will be meager .  or  in times of trouble .  likewise , the women should adorn themselves in appropriate  dress , with modesty and soundness of mind ,  not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing ,  or  respectable .  or  good judgment  sensibleness .  all the days of the afflicted one are bad , but the one with a cheerful  heart has a continual feast .  practice giving , and people will give to you .  they will pour into your laps a fine measure , pressed down , shaken together , and overflowing .  for with the measure that you are measuring out , they will measure out to you in return .  whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires  he rejects  all practical wisdom .  or  shows contempt for .  let your words always be gracious , seasoned with salt , so that you will know how you should answer each person .  also , let the peace of the christ rule in your hearts , for you were called to that peace in one body .  and show yourselves thankful .  there is hope for whoever is among the living , because a live dog is better off than a dead lion . 
life story as told by kevin williams people say i am much like my father .  my posture , my eyes , and my sense of humor have all come from him .  but he has also passed on something else  a legacy treasured by seven generations of my family .  let me explain .  his mother died two years later , so he and his three siblings were raised by their father , john williams .  john trained thomas to be a carpenter , but thomas aspired to a different career .  a religious revival was then sweeping through england .  preacher john wesley had split off from the church of england to form the society of methodists , a group that emphasized personal bible study and evangelism .  wesley ' s teachings spread like wildfire , and the williams family firmly embraced them .  thomas became a wesleyan preacher and promptly volunteered for missionary work in the south pacific .  during their early years in fiji , thomas and mary endured severe hardships .  they labored long hours in primitive conditions and tropical heat .  they also confronted unspeakable horrors  tribal war , strangling of widows , infanticide , and cannibalism  and the local people generally resisted their message .  mary and her firstborn son , john , fell sick and nearly died .  i was on the edge of desperation .  yet he and mary persevered , drawing strength from their faith in jehovah god .  thomas , meanwhile , put his carpentry skills to good use by building the first european - style house in fiji .  the dwelling featured a ventilated raised floor and other innovations that aroused great curiosity among the local fijians .  just before the house was completed , mary gave birth to her second son , thomas whitton   williams , my direct ancestor .  he was , however , a gifted anthropologist with keen powers of observation .  their second - oldest child , arthur bakewell   williams , my next direct ancestor , was then nine years old .  there he read some literature published by the international bible students , as jehovah ' s witnesses were then known .  he also subscribed to zion ' s watch tower .  fascinated by what he read , arthur began sharing his newfound knowledge with others and holding meetings for bible study .  from those humble beginnings sprang the modern activity of jehovah ' s witnesses in western australia .  arthur also told his family about what he was learning .  his father , thomas whitton , supported arthur ' s association with the bible students but died soon afterward .  his mother , phoebe , and his sisters , violet and mary , also became bible students .  violet became a full - time evangelizer , or pioneer .  arthur said that she was  the finest and the most zealous and earnest pioneer western australia produced .  arthur was probably biased , but violet ' s zealous example greatly influenced the next williams generation .  in time , arthur married and moved to donnybrook , a fruit - growing town in southwest western australia .  because of his zealous proclamation of bible prophecies pointing forward to that year .  the teasing stopped when world war i broke out .  arthur regularly witnessed to customers in a store that he owned , where he displayed bible literature prominently in the window .  no one ever collected the money .  the williams '  home became a focal point for group bible study and congregation meetings in donnybrook .  later , arthur built a kingdom hall , or meeting place , in town  one of the first in western australia .  arthur ' s children were deeply affected by their father , who was quiet and dignified , yet zealous .  his daughter florence   served as a missionary in india .  his sons , arthur lindsay   and thomas , like their father , served as longtime congregation elders .  arthur lindsay williams , my great grandfather , was known and loved for his kind disposition .  he always had time for people and treated them with respect .  arthur , however , was less than impressed when his two - year - old son , ronald     , took an ax to a small apple tree next to the family home .  ronald ' s mother carefully bandaged the tree , and it eventually bore apples of exceptional sweetness .  dubbed the lady williams apple , the new variety became a forebear of the cripps pink apple , one of the world ' s most popular apple varieties .  ronald , or gramp , as i call him , later turned to more constructive pursuits .  he and grandma served for years as volunteer workers on witness construction projects in australia and the solomon islands .  following our family legacy , my parents , geoffrey   and janice   williams , worked hard to raise my sister , katharine ,   and me   to value christian principles .  while attending a christian assembly , i heard john e .  barr , a member of the governing body of jehovah ' s witnesses , urge young ones in the audience   do not waste the most precious thing you have  the opportunity to know and love jehovah .  that night i dedicated my life to jehovah .  two years later , i started pioneering .  today , i enjoy preaching full - time with my wife , chloe , in tom price , a remote mining town in the northwest of western australia .  we work part - time to care for our needs .  dad and i also serve as congregation elders .  seven generations ago , my ancestor thomas williams determined to serve jehovah god .  that legacy of faith and service has been passed down to me .  i feel truly blessed to have such a rich spiritual heritage .  the number corresponds to the individual in the pictures that follow .  formerly called lakemba island , it is located in fiji ' s eastern lau group .  the translation is noteworthy in that it uses the divine name ,  jiova .  published by jehovah ' s witnesses and available online at www . 
a recent horror film was entitled antichrist .  a popular music group named one of its albums antichrist superstar .  kings and emperors in the middle ages often called their opponents antichrists .  martin luther , german reformation leader , labeled roman catholic popes as antichrists .  since the term  antichrist  has long been used as a label for everything from monarchs to movies , it is only natural to ask  who is the antichrist .  does this term have anything to do with us today .  surely the logical place to begin when searching for the identity of the antichrist is in the bible , where the term appears five times .  the only bible writer to use the word  antichrist  is the apostle john .  how did he describe the antichrist .  note these words in the first letter bearing his name   young children , it is the last hour , and just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have appeared , from which fact we know that it is the last hour .  they went out from us , but they were not of our sort .  who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ .  this is the antichrist , the one who denies the father and the son .  the apostle john understood the antichrist to be all who deliberately spread religious deception about jesus christ and jesus '  teachings what do we learn from those words .  john mentioned  many antichrists ,  indicating that the antichrist is , not an individual , but a collective term .  people or organizations making up the antichrist spread lies , deny that jesus is the christ , or the messiah , and try to distort the relationship between god and his son , jesus christ .  those who make up the antichrist claim to be christ or his representatives , but since  they went out from us ,  they deviated from true bible teachings .  furthermore , this group was present at the time when john wrote his letter , in  the last hour ,  presumably the end of the time of the apostles .  what else did john write regarding the antichrist .  speaking about false prophets , he warned   every inspired statement that acknowledges jesus christ as having come in the flesh originates with god .  but every inspired statement that does not acknowledge jesus does not originate with god .  furthermore , this is the antichrist ' s inspired statement that you have heard was coming , and now it is already in the world .  then , in his second letter , john reiterated this point   many deceivers have gone out into the world , those not acknowledging jesus christ as coming in the flesh .  this is the deceiver and the antichrist .  clearly , john understood the antichrist to be all who deliberately spread religious deception about jesus christ and jesus '  teachings .  jesus warned that false prophets would come as  ravenous wolves in sheep ' s covering '  long before john wrote about such religious deceivers , jesus christ advised his followers   be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheep ' s covering , but inside they are ravenous wolves .  the apostle paul likewise warned christians in thessalonica   let no one lead you astray in any way , because it  the day of jehovah  will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed , the son of destruction .  hence , in the first century , false prophets and apostates were already at work , endeavoring to weaken the christian congregation .  all those involved in spreading lies and religious deception about jesus christ and his teachings were included in john ' s term  antichrist .  jehovah ' s view of them was revealed when paul described them as  the son of destruction .  what about today .  people and organizations making up the antichrist still oppose christ and his teachings .  they deliberately spread lies and deceptions with the intent of confusing the identity of the father , jehovah god , and of his son , jesus christ .  we have good reason to beware of such religious deceptions .  let us look at two examples .  for centuries , the churches propagated the doctrine of the trinity , claiming that the father and the son are part of the same entity .  the antichrist thus shrouds in mystery the identity of jehovah god and jesus christ .  this mystery hinders sincere people from imitating jesus christ and drawing close to god , as the bible encourages them to .  the churches add to the confusion by promoting the use of bible translations that omit god ' s personal name , jehovah , from the text .  the identity of the true god becomes even more shrouded in mystery .  on the other hand , knowing god ' s name , jehovah , has helped many honesthearted worshippers to draw closer to god .  that was the experience of richard , who recalls a conversation with two of jehovah ' s witnesses .  they showed me from the bible that the name of the true god is jehovah ,  explains richard .  i was fascinated by the thought that god has a personal name , something i had never heard before .  from that point on , he made changes in his life to conform to bible standards and to please jehovah .  learning god ' s name has helped me to develop a close relationship with him .  for centuries , the antichrist has kept millions in spiritual darkness .  but by studying god ' s word , the bible , we are able to learn the true identity of the antichrist and be set free from the antichrist ' s religious lies and deceptions .  young children , it is the last hour , and just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have appeared , from which fact we know that it is the last hour .  but they went out so that it might be shown that not all are of our sort .  or  they did not belong to us .  who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ .  this is the antichrist , the one who denies the father and the son .  this is how you know that the inspired statement is from god  every inspired statement that acknowledges jesus christ as having come in the flesh originates with god .  furthermore , this is the antichrist ' s inspired statement that you have heard was coming , and now it is already in the world .  for many deceivers have gone out into the world , those not acknowledging jesus christ as coming in the flesh .  this is the deceiver and the antichrist .  be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheep ' s covering , but inside they are ravenous wolves .  let no one lead you astray  in any way , because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed , the son of destruction .  or  seduce you .  become imitators of me , just as i am of christ .  draw close to god , and he will draw close to you .  cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you indecisive ones .  sanctify them by means of the truth  your word is truth . 
do you teach your child to love god .  a home in which parents love and respect each other is an excellent environment for a child to grow up in .  good parents love their children and commend them , just as jehovah god commended his son .  our heavenly father listens to his servants , and he pays attention to their feelings .  parents do well to learn from him and listen to what their children have to say .  they should acknowledge their children ' s feelings , including negative expressions .  as a parent , you have the authority to make rules .  learn from god ' s example .  he expresses love for his children by clearly defining the rules and the consequences of disobeying them .  but rather than force people to obey , he teaches them how to benefit from doing what is right .  make it your goal to help your children to love god .  then they will act wisely even when they are not with you .  just as god teaches by example , teach your children to love god by your example .   , published by jehovah ' s witnesses also available at www .  org      but besides all these things , clothe yourselves with love , for it is a perfect bond of union .  you husbands , keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry  with them .  or  be harsh .  also , a voice from the heavens said   this is my son , the beloved , whom i have approved .  know this , my beloved brothers  everyone must be quick to listen , slow to speak , slow to anger ,       then moses said to jehovah   why have you afflicted your servant .  why have i not found favor in your eyes , so that you put the burden of all this people on me .  if this is how you are going to treat me , please kill me right now .  if i have found favor in your eyes , do not make me see any more calamity .  children , be obedient to your parents in union with the lord , for this is righteous .  but god has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden   you must not eat from it , no , you must not touch it  otherwise you will die .   '         if only you would pay attention to my commandments .  then your peace would become just like a river and your righteousness like the waves of the sea .  their name would never be cut off or annihilated from before me .  you must love jehovah your god with all your heart and all your soul  and all your strength .  see glossary .  or  vital force  resources .  or  repeat them to  impress them upon .  but become kind to one another , tenderly compassionate , freely forgiving one another just as god also by christ freely forgave you .  therefore , become imitators of god , as beloved children , .
