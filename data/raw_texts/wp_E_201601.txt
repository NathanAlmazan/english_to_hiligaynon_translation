why be honest .  hitoshi worked in the accounting office of an employment agency in japan .  while reviewing a financial account with his superior , hitoshi was told that he was expected to make a falsified report .  hitoshi explained that his conscience would not let him do dishonest work .  as a result , hitoshi ' s superior threatened to fire him , and he ultimately lost his job .  in the months that followed , hitoshi became downhearted over his employment prospects .  during one job interview , for instance , hitoshi mentioned that he could not engage in dishonest work .  the interviewer responded ,  your way of thinking is strange .  hitoshi ' s family and friends encouraged him to remain firm in his resolve to be honest , yet he began to have some doubts .  for instance , he said ,  i wondered if being honest about my faith was a good idea .  hitoshi ' s experience is a disturbing reminder that not everyone prizes honesty .  in fact , some may even view it as a liability , particularly in the business community .  i ' m surrounded by people who are dishonest ,  said a working woman in south africa ,  and sometimes the pressure to conform is very great .  one form of dishonesty that is particularly widespread today is lying .  some years ago , a study by robert s .  it was a very surprising result ,  says feldman .  we didn ' t expect lying to be such a common part of daily life .  is it not strange that most people abhor the idea of being lied to yet there are few practices more common than lying .  why are lying , stealing , and other forms of dishonesty so common today .  how does dishonesty affect society as a whole .  and more important , how can we avoid getting caught up in these dishonest practices . 
why be honest .  there are always difficult situations that can be solved with a little dishonesty .  samantha , south africa .  do you agree with that statement .  like samantha , all of us have faced difficult situations at one time or another .  how we react to situations that tempt us to be dishonest can reveal what values we hold dear .  for example , if saving face is paramount to us , we would likely view being dishonest as just another tool used to accomplish the task .  when the truth comes to light , however , dishonesty often brings negative consequences .  consider the following .  relationships are built on trust .  when two people trust each other , they feel safe and secure .  but trust does not happen overnight .  people build trust when they spend time together , engaging in honest communication and acting unselfishly .  trust can be shattered , however , by just one act of dishonesty .  and when trust has been broken , it can be very difficult to rebuild .  have you ever been deceived by someone you thought was a good friend .  if so , how did you feel .  likely you felt hurt , even betrayed .  that certainly is understandable .  there is little doubt that dishonesty can destroy the fabric of precious relationships .  a study by robert innes , a professor of economics at the university of california , found that  dishonesty is indeed contagious .  thus , dishonesty could be likened to a virus the more contact you have with a person who is deceitful , the greater your risk of being  infected  with dishonesty yourself .  how can you avoid falling into the trap of dishonesty .  the bible can help you .  please consider a few bible principles .  saying something false to someone who is entitled to know the truth .  lying can include misrepresenting or distorting facts in order to mislead a person , omitting key information to deceive someone , and exaggerating the truth in order to give a false impression .  what the bible says   jehovah detests a devious person , but his close friendship is with the upright .  now that you have put away deceit , each one of you speak truth with his neighbor .  uttering false and malicious statements that injure a person ' s reputation .  what the bible says   a troublemaker causes dissension , and a slanderer separates close friends .  where there is no wood , the fire goes out , and where there is no slanderer , quarreling ceases .  inducing someone to part with money or property on false pretenses .  what the bible says   you must not defraud a hired worker who is in need and poor .  the one who defrauds the lowly one insults his maker , but whoever shows compassion to the poor glorifies him .  taking property from a person without permission .  what the bible says   let the one who steals steal no more  rather , let him do hard work , doing good work with his hands , so that he may have something to share with someone in need .  do not be misled .  thieves , greedy people , drunkards , revilers , and extortioners will not inherit god ' s kingdom .  for jehovah detests a devious person , but his close friendship is with the upright .  therefore , now that you have put away deceit , each one of you speak truth with his neighbor , because we are members belonging to one another .  a troublemaker  causes dissension , and a slanderer separates close friends .  or  a schemer .  where there is no wood , the fire goes out , and where there is no slanderer , quarreling ceases .  you must not defraud a hired worker who is in need and poor , whether one of your brothers or a foreign resident in your land , within your cities .  otherwise , he will cry out to jehovah against you , and you will be guilty of sin .  the one who defrauds the lowly one insults his maker , but whoever shows compassion to the poor glorifies him .  let the one who steals steal no more  rather , let him do hard work , doing good work with his hands , so that he may have something to share with someone in need .  or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit god ' s kingdom .  do not be misled .  or  deceived .  see glossary ,  sexual immorality .  or  men who have sex with men .   ,  men who lie with men .  or  the verbally abusive . 
why be honest .  we trust we have an honest conscience , as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things .  in the bible , the original greek word that is sometimes translated  honesty  literally means  something that is intrinsically good .  it can also carry the meaning of something beautiful to behold in a moral sense .  christians take seriously the apostle paul ' s inspired words   we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things .  what does that involve .  most people glance at themselves in a mirror every morning before going out in public .  because they want to look their best .  but there is something much more important than having a stylish haircut or fashionable clothes .  indeed , the person we are on the inside can either add to or detract from our outward appearance .  god ' s word frankly admits that we are inclined to do what is bad .  thus , to be honest , we must fight against our inborn sinful tendencies .  the apostle paul gave a vivid description of his own fight against sin , saying   i really delight in the law of god according to the man i am within , but i see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin ' s law that is in my body .  for example , when our heart urges us to do what is bad and we have a strong inclination to be dishonest , we do not have to be a slave to our heart ' s impulses .  we still have a choice in the matter .  when we choose to reject a bad thought , we can remain honest despite the dishonesty surrounding us .  to be honest , we need a strong moral code .  sadly , however , many people spend more time deciding on their personal  dress code '  than they do on thinking about a personal moral code .  as a result , they justify the amount of dishonesty that will suit their situation .  the book the   truth about dishonesty put it this way   essentially , we cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self - image as reasonably honest individuals .  is there , though , a reliable standard that can help us decide for ourselves how much if any dishonesty is acceptable .  thankfully , there is .  millions of people the world over have found that the bible perfectly fills that need .  the bible has a moral code that is beyond compare .  it gives reliable guidance on such matters as family life , employment , morality , and spirituality .  it has stood the test of time .  its laws and principles apply to all national groups , races , tribes , and peoples .  by peering into the bible , meditating on what it says , and applying its counsel , we can train our heart to be honest and upright .  still , there is more to winning the battle against dishonesty than gaining an accurate knowledge of the bible .  after all , we live in a morally depraved world that pressures us to accept its corrupt standards .  that is why we need to pray to god for his help and support .  by doing so , we can have the courage to stand up for what is right and to be honest in all things .  hitoshi , quoted in the opening article , profited from having a reputation of being an honest worker .  he now works for an employer who appreciates his honesty .  i am thankful ,  says hitoshi ,  that i was able to find work that allows me to keep a clean conscience .  others have found the same to be true .  consider some examples of those who have benefited by applying the bible principle to  conduct ourselves honestly in all things .  later , i married , and my husband and i began studying the bible with jehovah ' s witnesses .  we learned that jehovah  god hates dishonest practices , so we decided to change our lifestyle .  in the past , my house was full of stolen goods , but now it is free from such things  and this gives me a clean conscience .  thinking back over my many years of dishonesty , i am grateful to jehovah for his great mercy .  it is so satisfying to go to sleep each night knowing that jehovah is now pleased with me .  cheryl , ireland .  when my boss found out that i had turned down a bribe from a potential customer , he said to me   your god makes you such a trustworthy person .  it truly is a blessing to have you here in our company .   '  to be honest in all things enables me to have a clean conscience before jehovah god .  it also allows me to help my family and others to do the same .  sonny , hong kong .  i work as an executive assistant at an international bank .  in this business , honesty is often shoved aside for the sake of gaining wealth .  the widespread view is ,  what ' s the harm in a little dishonesty if it promotes wealth and helps the economy .   '  but by being honest , i have peace of mind .  i am resolved to remain honest and face whatever consequences may come .  my employers know that i will not lie to them or for them .  tom , united states .  my supervisor at work encouraged me to lie about some missing supplies at work , but i refused .  when the thieves were finally revealed , my employer thanked me for being honest .  being honest in a dishonest world calls for courage .  but in the end , we can gain the trust and respect of others .  kaori , japan .  a clean conscience , peace of mind , and self - respect such rewards show that it really does pay to be honest .  do you not agree .  keep praying for us , for we trust we have an honest  conscience , as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things .  and jehovah began to smell a pleasing  aroma .  so jehovah said in his heart   never again will i curse  the ground on man ' s account , for the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up  and never again will i strike down every living thing as i have done .  or  appeasing  soothing .  or  call down evil upon .  the law of jehovah is perfect , restoring strength .  the reminder of jehovah is trustworthy , making the inexperienced one wise .  or  restoring   the soul .  or  your minds  your thoughts .  for all things i have the strength through the one who gives me power .  or  his soul . 
my father was french , and my mother is italian .  when i was eight years old , we moved to a poor working - class suburb of rome , italy .  there , home life became difficult .  my parents argued violently because of their financial problems .  so i began to leave home for longer and longer periods of time .  soon i fell into bad company .  one day a man , who seemed friendly , approached me .  he offered me drugs , which i took because i wanted to appear grown - up .  i was quickly drawn into an underworld of drugs and immorality .  on many occasions , i was violated sexually .  life became unimportant to me  i did not care if i lived or died .  i was desperately lonely .  i wound up in a coma for three days .  i began to appreciate life , but i also became violent and devious .  i would offer people sex , drug them in their home , and then steal anything they had that was valuable .  large crime syndicates used me to traffic drugs around italy .  i was frequently in trouble with the police .  my life seemed pointless and out of control .  however , i did believe that there had to be a reason for my existence .  i prayed to god , asking him to give me just one year of peace and happiness .  because of my activities with drug dealers , my life was in danger .  before i left , i visited my mother and was surprised to see a man named annunziato lugar� talking to her about the bible .  knowing his criminal history , i became afraid and asked him why he was there .  he told me about the major changes he had made in his life in order to become one of jehovah ' s witnesses , and he made me promise to speak to the witnesses when i arrived in england .  i agreed to do so .  however , once i arrived there , i quickly reverted to my previous lifestyle .  one day , i met a witness who was offering the watchtower and awake .  magazines on a busy london street .  remembering my promise to annunziato , i asked the witness if i could have a bible study .  what i learned from the bible truly amazed me .  that verse had a dramatic effect on me because i felt very dirty on account of my lifestyle .  i immediately started to attend meetings at the kingdom hall of jehovah ' s witnesses .  the witnesses welcomed me warmly .  when i saw the closeness of their friendships something i had always longed for i wanted to be a part of their familylike congregation .  although i did not have a lot of difficulty quitting drugs and leaving my immoral lifestyle , i found it much harder to refine my personality .  i saw that i needed to treat people with respect and consideration .  in fact , i am still fighting some bad traits .  but with jehovah ' s help , i have made progress .  within six months of beginning to study the bible , i was baptized as one of jehovah ' s witnesses .  after baptism , i married a young woman named barbara who had also recently become one of jehovah ' s witnesses .  when one of my old friends saw how much i had changed , he started to study the bible .  in time , he became a witness , and so did his sister .  i now serve as an elder in a local congregation , and my wife and i are full - time ministers , helping to teach the bible to italian - speaking people in london .  at times , i get depressed about my former lifestyle , but barbara is an enormous support to me .  at last , i have the stable family life that i always craved , and i have the loving father that i always wanted .  i asked god for one year of peace and happiness , but he has given me so much more .  at last , i have the stable family life that i always craved , and i have the loving father that i always wanted   par .  if we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . 
did you know .  the gospel of luke speaks of jesus '  opening the scroll of isaiah , reading from it , and then rerolling it .  at the end of john ' s gospel , john too spoke of a scroll , saying that he was not able to include in his scroll all the signs that jesus had performed .  how were scrolls made .  pieces of such materials as leather , parchment , or papyrus were glued together to form a strip , or a roll .  this could then be wrapped around a rod with the written face on the inside .  the writing appeared in short vertical columns across the width of the roll .  if the scroll was long , it would have rods at both ends , which the reader would use to unroll the text with one hand and roll it up with the other , until the desired place was found .  in some cases , a scroll ' s top and bottom edges were trimmed , rubbed smooth with pumice stone , and dyed .  from the inception of the israelite priesthood , only one man at a time served in the capacity of high priest , which initially was a lifelong appointment .  aaron was the first to serve in this capacity .  subsequently , the honor generally passed from father to oldest son .  many of aaron ' s male descendants served as priests , but only relatively few as high priests .  when israel came under foreign domination , non - israelite rulers appointed and removed jewish high priests at will .  it appears , however , that new appointees were almost always chosen from a select number of privileged families , mostly from the line of aaron .  the expression  chief priests  evidently refers to principal members of the priesthood .  this is how you should install aaron and his sons to serve as priests .   ,  fill the hand of aaron and the hand of his sons .  or  the messiah  the anointed one . 
nothing seems more helpless than a newborn baby .  when we came into the world our security depended entirely on our parents .  when we learned to walk , we met strangers who towered over us like giants .  they frightened us unless our parents were close at hand .  but we felt safe when we grasped the hand of our mother or father .  during childhood , our well - being depended on the love and encouragement that our parents gave us .  when we realized that our parents loved us , it reinforced our sense of security .  when they assured us that we were doing well , we felt more confident and we made progress .  as we got a bit older , close friends also provided additional security .  we felt comfortable in their presence , and they made the school environment seem less intimidating .  those thoughts , of course , describe the ideal childhood .  some youngsters find few close friends , and too many children receive scant parental support .  whenever i see pictures of united families doing things together , i think to myself ,  i wish i had enjoyed that when i was a young girl , '   confesses melissa .  perhaps you feel the same way .  maybe you lacked confidence during your formative years .  perhaps you received little love and encouragement .  possibly , you remember the constant fights between your parents that led to the breakup of their marriage a separation you may have mistakenly blamed on yourself .  or even worse , perhaps one of your parents abused you verbally or physically .  how may an insecure child react .  some turn to drugs or binge drinking during their teenage years .  others join gangs in search of a sense of belonging .  insecure teenagers may jump into a romantic relationship , seeking love and affection .  but these relationships rarely last long , and the breakup often causes even more insecurity .  vulnerable teenagers who avoid such major pitfalls may still grow up with little sense of self - worth .  i became convinced that i was useless , since that is what my mother told me time and time again ,  explains ana .  i can ' t remember receiving any commendation or affection from her .  our upbringing is not the only cause of insecurity .  we may feel insecure as a result of a traumatic divorce , the trials of old age , or even concern about our appearance .  whatever the cause , it can rob us of happiness and damage our relationships with others .  what can we do to overcome those feelings .  we need to know that help is available .  we all have someone who can help us , someone who wants to help us god himself .  this is the message god set out through his prophet isaiah   do not be anxious , for i am your god .  i will fortify you , yes , i will help you , i will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness .  how comforting to think that god figuratively wants to take us by the hand .  we have no need to feel anxious .  the bible describes worshippers of god who felt anxious but who learned to hold god ' s hand .  hannah , the mother of samuel , felt that she was a failure , since she could not have a baby .  she was often ridiculed for her barrenness .  as a result , hannah lost her appetite and often wept .  but after she poured out her feelings to god , she no longer felt miserable .  the psalmist david also felt insecure at times .  for years , king saul tried to hunt him down .  david survived several attempts on his life , and he sometimes felt he was drowning in his problems .  despite this , he wrote   i will lie down and sleep in peace , for you alone , o jehovah , make me dwell in security .  both hannah and david threw their emotional burdens on jehovah , and they found that he did sustain them .  how can we do the same today .  jesus urged us to get to know his father ,  the only true god .  he is not far off from each one of us ,  the apostle paul assures us .  draw close to god , and he will draw close to you ,  wrote james .  knowing that we have a heavenly father who loves and cares for us is a vital step in overcoming feelings of anxiety .  true , it may take time to build this trust , but many have found that doing so really helps .  when jehovah became my father , i finally had someone to whom i could express my inner feelings ,  says caroline .  this brought me so much relief .  jehovah is the one who helped me to feel secure when i was left all alone without my parents ,  recalls rachel .  i could talk to him and ask him to help me with my problems .  and he did help me .  jesus taught his disciples to think of one another as brothers and sisters .  all of you are brothers ,  he told them .  he wanted his true disciples to love one another and become what we could call a large spiritual family .  congregations of jehovah ' s witnesses sincerely try to provide the warmth and comfort of a true spiritual family .  many have found that congregation meetings can serve as a soothing ointment that cures their emotional cuts and bruises .  i had a special friend in my local congregation , who understood the pain i was suffering ,  recalls eva .  she listened to me , read to me , and prayed with me .  she made sure i was not alone .  she helped me talk things through and unburden myself .  thanks to her support , i began to feel more secure .  i found a  mother and father '  in the congregation ,  rachel adds .  they really made me feel loved and secure .  showing love and kindness to others builds lasting friendships .  jesus said   there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving .  and we will doubtless discover that the more love we show , the more we receive .  practice giving , and people will give to you ,  jesus told his disciples .  by giving and receiving love , we feel much more secure .  as the bible points out ,  love never fails .  i know that some negative views i have about myself are simply not true ,  mar�a admits .  i escape from this frame of mind by helping others and forgetting myself .  i always feel satisfied when i do something for others .  the above steps are not a  magic formula '  that provides instant , lasting relief .  but they can make a big difference .  i still have feelings of insecurity ,  caroline admits .  but now i have more self - worth .  i know god cares for me , and i have many close friends who also make me feel secure .  rachel feels the same way .  from time to time , sadness overwhelms me ,  she says .  but i have spiritual brothers and sisters i can turn to for advice , ones who help me see things positively .  and above all , i have a heavenly father whom i talk to every day .  that makes all the difference .  the bible describes a coming new world , where each one of us will feel secure there is also a lasting solution .  the bible describes a coming new world , where each one of us will feel secure .  god ' s word promises   they will sit , each one under his vine and under his fig tree , and no one will make them afraid .  at that time , nobody will make us feel unprotected , nor will anyone do us harm .  even deep - rooted traumas of the past  will not be called to mind .  god and his son , christ jesus , will establish  true righteousness .  the result  will be lasting tranquillity and security .  when my drunken father used to explode in anger , his appearance changed .  he became like a wolf baring its teeth before attacking its prey without mercy .  and i was like a frightened lamb , cowering out of sight , hoping he wouldn ' t see me .  i lived this nightmare almost every day .  caroline ' s memories of her childhood .  i felt i couldn ' t trust anyone .  it seemed as if i were lost on top of a mountain shouting for help , but there was nobody who could hear me , no one who could lead me to safety .  eva , a recently divorced woman .  my father would often yell at me ,  you ' re bad .  nobody will ever love you .   '  for years i have tried to convince myself that i am not a bad person and that others really like me .  i felt like a puppy with its tail between its legs , always looking for a kindly pat , but never getting one .  mark , whose father demeaned him .  i sometimes look at an attractive woman and compare her to a beautiful orchid that people would love to have in their home .  but i am more like a common weed that wouldn ' t interest anyone .  mar�a , a young woman who struggles with feelings of inferiority .  i felt so lonely .  i wanted somebody to look after me and to tell me i was doing well .  but i felt i was lost in a big , dark forest .  although i carried on day by day , i wanted to find an escape from this forest .  i wanted to feel secure and happy .  rachel , a daughter of emigrant workers .  do not be afraid , for i am with you .  do not be anxious , for i am your god .  i will fortify you , yes , i will help you , i will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness .   '       for i , jehovah your god , am grasping your right hand , the one saying to you ,  do not be afraid .  i will help you .   '       moreover , her rival wife taunted her relentlessly in order to upset her because jehovah had not given her children .  but her husband el ka nah said to her   han nah , why do you weep , and why do you not eat , and why are you so sad .  am i not better to you than ten sons .  or  why does your heart feel bad .  to this she said   let your servant find favor in your eyes .  and the woman went on her way and ate , and her face was no longer downcast .  because of what the enemy is saying and the pressure from the wicked one .  for they heap trouble upon me , and in anger they harbor animosity against me .  save me , o god , for the waters threaten my life .  or  have come to my soul .  i will lie down and sleep in peace , for you alone , o jehovah , make me dwell in security .  throw your burden on jehovah , and he will sustain you .  never will he allow the righteous one to fall .  or  stagger  totter .  this means everlasting life , their coming to know you ,  the only true god , and the one whom you sent , jesus christ .  or  their taking in knowledge of you .  so that they would seek god , if they might grope for him and really find him , although , in fact , he is not far off from each one of us .  draw close to god , and he will draw close to you .  cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you indecisive ones .  but you , do not you be called rabbi , for one is your teacher , and all of you are brothers .  in reply he said to the one who spoke to him   who is my mother , and who are my brothers .  my mother and my brothers .  by this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love among yourselves .  or  be concerned about  pay attention to .  or  motivate  stir up .  i have shown you in all things that by working hard in this way , you must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the lord jesus , when he himself said   there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving .   '        practice giving , and people will give to you .  they will pour into your laps a fine measure , pressed down , shaken together , and overflowing .  for with the measure that you are measuring out , they will measure out to you in return .  love never fails .  but if there are gifts of prophecy , they will be done away with  if there are tongues ,  they will cease  if there is knowledge , it will be done away with .  that is , miraculous speaking in other languages .  they will sit ,  each one under his vine and under his fig tree , and no one will make them afraid , for the mouth of jehovah of armies has spoken .  i am creating new heavens and a new earth  and the former things will not be called to mind ,  nor will they come up into the heart .  or  be remembered .  the wolf and the lamb will feed together , the lion will eat straw just like the bull , and the serpent ' s food will be dust .  they will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain ,  says jehovah .  the result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquillity and security . 
ancient wisdom for modern living
do not be anxious
ancient wisdom for modern living bible principle   stop being anxious about your lives .  what does it mean .  jesus spoke those words in his sermon on the mount .  according to one bible dictionary , the greek verb rendered  to be anxious  can refer to  the natural reaction of man to poverty , hunger and other troubles which befall him in his daily life .  anxiety often involves being worried about things that may take place in the future .  it is normal and proper to be concerned about our material needs and the welfare of our loved ones .  but when jesus said ,  never be anxious ,  he was advising his followers to avoid undue worry an excessive fear of tomorrow that can take the joy out of living today .  is it practical today .  we are wise to heed jesus '  advice .  some reference works suggest that when people worry a great deal , their sympathetic nervous system is in a constant state of activation and that this condition  is associated with medical problems that include ulcers , heart disease , and asthma .  jesus gave a compelling reason for avoiding undue anxiety  it is pointless .  who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span .  asked jesus .  focusing on our worries will not extend our life by even a fraction of a second , let alone improve it .  besides , things often do not turn out as we feared .  one scholar put it this way   worry about the future is wasted effort , and the future of reality is seldom as bad as the future of our fears .  how can we avoid anxiety .  first , trust in god .  if god provides food for birds and clothes flowers with beauty , will he not provide the necessities of life for humans who make his worship a priority in their life .  second , take one day at a time .  never be anxious about the next day ,  said jesus ,  for the next day will have its own anxieties .  would you not agree that  each day has enough of its own troubles .  by heeding jesus '  wise advice , we can spare ourselves physical harm .  more than that , we will find an inner calm what the bible calls  the peace of god .  on this account i say to you  stop being anxious about your lives  as to what you will eat or what you will drink , or about your bodies as to what you will wear .  does not life  mean more than food and the body than clothing .  or  the soul .  for i have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for your concerns .  so never be anxious and say ,  what are we to eat .

'       so never be anxious about the next day , for the next day will have its own anxieties .  each day has enough of its own troubles .  who of you by being anxious can add one cubit  to his life span .  on this account i say to you  stop being anxious about your lives  as to what you will eat or what you will drink , or about your bodies as to what you will wear .  does not life  mean more than food and the body than clothing .  are you not worth more than they are .  or  the soul .  also , why are you anxious about clothing .  so never be anxious about the next day , for the next day will have its own anxieties .  each day has enough of its own troubles .  or  your minds  your thoughts . 
some people believe that we live on in another form , while others feel that death is the end of everything .  what do you believe .  what the bible says  the dead know nothing at all .  when we die , we cease to exist .  what else we learn from the bible   the first man , adam , returned to the dust when he died .  likewise , all others who die return to the dust .  people who die are acquitted of , or pardoned for , their sins .  there is no further punishment for sin after a person dies .  what would you say .  yes   no   maybe what the bible says  there is going to be a resurrection .  what else can we learn from the bible .  the bible often compares death to sleep .  god can awaken the dead , just as we can awaken a person from sleep .  the bible records several resurrections , thus giving us a solid basis for believing that the dead will be raised up .   , published by jehovah ' s witnesses also available at www .  org     for the living know  that they will die , but the dead know nothing at all , nor do they have any more reward ,  because all memory of them is forgotten .  or  are conscious .  and jehovah god went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life , and the man became a living person .  hebrew , ne phesh , which literally means  a breathing creature .  see glossary .  in the sweat of your face you will eat bread  until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken .  for dust you are and to dust you will return .  for there is an outcome  for humans and an outcome for animals  they all have the same outcome .  as the one dies , so the other dies  and they all have but one spirit .  so man has no superiority over animals , for everything is futile .  they all come from the dust , and they all are returning to the dust .  or  eventuality .  for the one who has died has been acquitted  from his sin .  or  released  pardoned .  and i have hope toward god , which hope these men also look forward to , that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous .  after he said these things , he added   laz a rus our friend has fallen asleep , but i am traveling there to awaken him .  but they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep .  i will wait all the days of my compulsory service until my relief comes .  you will long  for the work of your hands .  or  sheol ,  that is , the common grave of mankind .  see glossary .  after these things , the son of the woman who owned the house fell sick , and his sickness became so severe that he stopped breathing .  have you come to remind me of my guilt and to put my son to death .  then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the roof chamber , where he was staying , and he laid him on his own bed .  or  what do i have to do with you , .  or  came to life .  soon afterward he traveled to a city called na in , and his disciples and a large crowd were traveling with him .  there was a dead man being carried out , the only  son of his mother .  besides , she was a widow .  a considerable crowd from the city was also with her .  then he said   young man , i say to you , get up .   ,  only - begotten .  or  funeral stretcher .  jesus said   take the stone away .  martha , the sister of the deceased , said to him   lord , by now he must smell , for it has been four days .  then jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said   father , i thank you that you have heard me .  jesus said to them   free him and let him go . 
life was tough .  i never knew my real mother , and i didn ' t have a good relationship with my father .  i grew up learning the rules of the streets .  by the time i was ten years old , i had already started stealing .  on more than one occasion , my father had to pick me up at police headquarters and take me home .  i argued with people constantly i was violent and angry with the whole world .  i started taking drugs and living on the street .  not having anywhere to sleep , i would break into a car and stay in it until the early morning hours .  then i would look for a water fountain so that i could wash up .  i became really good at stealing anything from bag snatching to robbing apartments and villas during the night .  i started to gain a bad reputation and was soon invited to join a notorious gang , which allowed me the  opportunity  to upgrade to robbing banks .  because of my aggressive personality , i was soon a respected member of the gang .  i never went anywhere without my gun  in fact , i slept with it under my pillow .  violence , drugs , stealing , foul language , and immorality became my way of life .  the police were constantly on my heels .  i was arrested several times , and i spent years in and out of prison .  how the bible changed my life  on one occasion when i was let out of prison , i decided to go and visit one of my aunts .  unbeknownst to me , my aunt and two of my cousins had become jehovah ' s witnesses .  they invited me to attend a meeting of the witnesses .  out of curiosity , i decided to go with them .  when we arrived at the kingdom hall , i insisted on sitting near the door so that i could keep an eye on those who came in and out .  of course , i was armed .  that meeting changed my life .  i remember thinking that i must be on a different planet .  i was greeted by people with warm , friendly smiling faces .  i still have a vivid picture in my mind of the kind , honest look the witnesses had in their eyes .  this was certainly a million miles away from the world i was used to .  i started to study the bible with the witnesses .  the more i learned , the clearer it became that i had to change my lifestyle completely .  i realized that i needed to distance myself from the gang .  that was not easy to do , but with jehovah ' s help , i succeeded .  i also cleaned myself up physically .  with much effort , i stopped smoking cigarettes and using drugs .  i cut my long hair , got rid of my earrings , and stopped using bad language .  for the first time in my life , i started to have control over my actions .  i had never enjoyed reading and studying , so it was a real challenge to concentrate and apply myself to bible study .  however , as i made the effort , i gradually came to love jehovah , and something started to change inside me my conscience began to bother me .  i often had negative feelings about myself , doubting that jehovah could ever forgive me for all the bad that i had done .  in those moments i found a lot of comfort in reading about jehovah forgiving king david after he had committed serious sins .  another challenge was sharing my faith with others in the door - to - door ministry .  i was terrified that i would meet someone whom i had hurt or wronged in some way in the past .  but gradually i was able to overcome my fear .  i began to find real satisfaction in helping others learn about our wonderful heavenly father , who forgives so abundantly .  how i have benefited  learning about jehovah saved my life .  most of my former companions are dead or in prison , but i have a truly satisfying life and a future to look forward to .  i have learned to be humble and obedient and to control my volcanic temper .  as a result , i enjoy better relationships with the people around me .  i am happily married to my beautiful wife , carmen .  together , we find great joy in helping others learn about the bible .  oh , and i now do honest work it sometimes still involves banks , but instead of robbing them , i clean them . 
chapter six where are the dead .  what happens to us when we die .  why do we die .  would it be comforting to know the truth about death .  these are questions that people have thought about for thousands of years .  they are important questions .  no matter who we are or where we live , the answers concern each one of us .  we also learned that the bible foretells a time when  death will be no more .  meanwhile , we all die .  the living know that they will die ,  said wise king solomon .  we try to live as long as possible .  still , we wonder what will happen to us when we die .  and we may ask   what has happened to them .  are they suffering .  are they watching over us .  can we help them .  will we ever see them again .   '  the world ' s religions offer differing answers to these questions .  some teach that if you live a good life , you will go to heaven but if you live a bad life , you will burn in a place of torment .  other religions teach that at death , people pass on to the spirit realm to be with their ancestors .  still other religions teach that the dead go to an underworld to be judged and are then reincarnated , or reborn in another body .  according to almost every religion , past and present , we somehow live on forever with the ability to see , hear , and think .  yet , how can that be .  our senses , along with our thoughts , are all linked to the workings of our brain .  at death , the brain stops working .  our memories , feelings , and senses do not continue to function independently in some mysterious way .  they do not survive the destruction of our brain .  what really happens at death .  he knows the truth , and in his word , the bible , he explains the condition of the dead .  its clear teaching is this  when a person dies , he ceases to exist .  death is the opposite of life .  the dead do not see or hear or think .  not even one part of us survives the death of the body .  we do not possess an immortal soul or spirit .  he then enlarged on that basic truth by saying that the dead can neither love nor hate and that  there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave .  we are mortal and do not survive the death of our body .  the life we enjoy is like the flame of a candle .  when the flame is put out , it does not go anywhere .  it is simply gone .  he did so with regard to lazarus , a man whom he knew well and who had died .  jesus told his disciples   lazarus our friend has fallen asleep .  the disciples thought that jesus meant that lazarus was resting in sleep , recovering from an illness .  they were wrong .  jesus explained   lazarus has died .  notice that jesus compared death to sleep .  lazarus was neither in heaven nor in a burning hell .  he was not meeting angels or ancestors .  lazarus was not being reborn as another human .  he was at rest in death , as though in a deep sleep without dreams .  other scriptures also compare death to sleep .  for example , when the disciple stephen was stoned to death , the bible says that he  fell asleep .  similarly , the apostle paul wrote about some in his day who had  fallen asleep in death .  jehovah made man to live forever on earth .  as we learned earlier in this book , god placed the first human couple in a delightful paradise .  he blessed them with perfect health .  jehovah wanted only good for them .  does any loving parent want his children to suffer the pain of old age and death .  of course not .  jehovah loved his children and wanted them to enjoy endless happiness on earth .  concerning humans , the bible says    jehovah  has even put eternity in their heart .  god created us with the desire to live forever .  and he has opened the way for that desire to be fulfilled .  to find the answer , we must consider what happened when there was only one man and one woman on earth .  the bible explains   jehovah god made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food .  however , there was one restriction .  jehovah told adam   from every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction .  but as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad , you must not eat from it , for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die .  this command was not difficult to obey .  there were many other trees from which adam and eve could eat .  but they now received a special opportunity to show their gratitude to the one who had given them everything , including perfect life .  their obedience would also show that they respected the authority of their heavenly father and that they wanted his loving direction .  speaking through a serpent , satan asked eve   did god really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden .  eve replied   we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden .  but god has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden   you must not eat from it , no , you must not touch it  otherwise you will die .  god knows that in the very day you eat from it , your eyes will be opened and you will be like god , knowing good and bad .  satan wanted eve to believe that she would benefit by eating the forbidden fruit .  according to him , she could decide for herself what was right and what was wrong  she could do what she wanted .  satan also charged that jehovah had lied about the consequences of eating the fruit .  eve believed satan .  so she picked some of the fruit and ate it .  she then gave some to her husband , and he too ate some of it .  they did not act in ignorance .  they knew that they were doing exactly what god had told them not to do .  by eating the fruit , they deliberately disobeyed a simple and reasonable command .  they showed contempt for their heavenly father and his authority .  such disrespect for their loving creator was inexcusable .  that would cause you much heartache .  imagine , then , how hurt jehovah must have felt when both adam and eve took a course of opposition to him .  they died , just as he had said they would .  adam and eve ceased to exist .  they did not pass on to the spirit realm .  we know this because of what jehovah said to adam after confronting him with his disobedience .  god said   you  will  return to the ground , for out of it you were taken .  for dust you are and to dust you will return .  god had made adam from the dust of the ground .  before that , adam did not exist .  therefore , when jehovah said that adam would return to the dust , he meant that adam would return to a state of nonexistence .  adam would be as lifeless as the dust from which he was made .  the reason we die is that adam ' s sinful condition as well as death was passed on to all of his descendants .  that sin is like a terrible inherited disease from which no one can escape .  its consequence , death , is a curse .  death is an enemy , not a friend .  how grateful we can be that jehovah provided the ransom to rescue us from this dreadful enemy .  as we have seen , the dead do not suffer pain or heartache .  there is no reason to be afraid of them , for they cannot harm us .  they do not need our help , and they cannot help us .  we cannot speak with them , and they cannot speak with us .  many religious leaders falsely claim that they can help those who have died , and people who believe such leaders give them money .  but knowing the truth protects us from being deceived by those who teach such lies .  most do not .  because their teachings have been influenced by satan .  he uses false religion to get people to believe that after their body dies , they will continue to live in the spirit realm .  this is a lie that satan combines with other lies to turn people away from jehovah god .  this teaching dishonors god .  jehovah is a god of love and would never make people suffer in this way .  how would you feel about a man who punished a disobedient child by holding his hands in a fire .  would you respect such a man .  in fact , would you even want to get to know him .  definitely not .  you would likely think that he was very cruel .  yet , satan wants us to believe that jehovah tortures people in fire forever for countless billions of years .  according to this teaching , the spirits of the dead can become powerful friends or terrible enemies .  many people believe this lie .  they fear the dead and give them honor and worship .  in contrast , the bible teaches that the dead are sleeping and that we should worship only the true god , jehovah , our creator and provider .  it also helps you to understand other bible teachings .  for example , when you realize that people do not pass on to the spirit realm at death , the promise of everlasting life on a paradise earth takes on real meaning for you .  can a lifeless person who is sleeping in death be brought back to life .  what the bible teaches about this is deeply comforting , as the next chapter will show .  footnote  for a discussion of the words  soul  and  spirit ,  please see the appendix article   soul '  and  spirit '  what do these terms really mean .  what the bible teaches   the dead do not see or hear or think .  the dead are asleep  they do not suffer .  we die because we inherited sin from adam .  what questions do people ask about death , and what answers do various religions offer .  what basic idea do many religions share concerning death .  what does the bible teach about the condition of the dead .  how did jesus explain what death is like .  how do we know that it was not god ' s purpose for people to die .  what restriction did jehovah place upon adam , and why was this command not difficult to obey .  how did the first human couple come to disobey god .  why was the disobedience of adam and eve a serious matter .  what may help us to understand how jehovah felt when adam and eve took a course of opposition to him .  what did jehovah say would happen to adam at death , and what does this mean .  why do we die .  why is it comforting to know the truth about death .  who has influenced the teachings of many religions , and in what way .  why does the teaching of eternal torment dishonor jehovah .  worship of the dead is based on what religious lie .  knowing the truth about death helps us to understand what other bible teaching .  what question will we consider in the next chapter .
